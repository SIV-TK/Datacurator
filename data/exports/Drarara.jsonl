"CHEMISTRY FORM ONE NOTES\nIntroduction to chemistry\nChemistry is a branch of Science. Science is basically the study of living and non-living things. The branch of science that study living things is called Biology. The branch of science that study non-living things is called Physical Science. Physical Science is made up of:\nPhysics- the study of matter in relation to energy\nChemistry- the study of the composition of matter. Chemistry is thus defined as the branch of science that deals with the structure composition, properties and behavior of matter. Basic Chemistry involves studying:\nStates/phases of matter\nMatter is anything that has weight/mass and occupies space/volume. Naturally, there are basically three states of matter. (i) Solid-e.g. soil, sand, copper metal, bucket, ice. (ii)Liquid- e.g. water, Petrol, ethanol/alcohol, Mercury (liquid metal). (iii) gas- e.g. Oxygen, Nitrogen ,Water vapour. A solid is made up of particles which are very closely packed. It thus has a definite/fixed shape and fixed/definite volume /occupies definite space. It has a very high density. A liquid is made up of particles which have some degree of freedom. It thus has no definite/fixed shape. It takes the shape of the container it is put. A liquid has fixed/definite volume/occupies definite space. A gas is made up of particles free from each other. It thus has no definite/fixed shape. It takes the shape of the container it is put. It has no fixed/definite volume/occupies every space in a container. (b) Separation of mixture\nA mixture is a combination of two or more substances that can be separated by physical means. Simple methods of separating mixtures at basic chemistry level include:\ni) Sorting/picking-this involve physically picking one pure substance from a mixture with another/other. e. g. sorting maize from maize beans mixture. ii) Decantation-this involve pouring out a liquid from a solid that has settled /sinking solid in it. e. g. Decanting water forms sand. iii)Filtration-this involves sieving /passing particles of a mixture through a filter containing small holes that allow smaller particle to pass through but do not allow bigger particle to pass through. iv) Skimming-this involve scooping floating particles. E.g."
"iii)Filtration-this involves sieving /passing particles of a mixture through a filter containing small holes that allow smaller particle to pass through but do not allow bigger particle to pass through. iv) Skimming-this involve scooping floating particles. E.g. cream from milk\n(c) Metals and non-metals\nMetals are shiny, ductile(able to form wires), malleable(able to form sheet) and coil without breaking. E.g. Iron, gold, silver, copper. Mercury is the only liquid metal known. Non-metals are dull, not ductile (do not form wires), not malleable (do not form sheet) and break on coiling/brittle. E.g. Charcoal, Sulphur, pla-stics. (d) Conductors and non-conductors\nA conductor is a solid that allow electric current to pass through. A non-conductor is a solid that do not allow electric current to pass through. All metals conduct electricity. All non-metals do not conduct electricity except carbon graphite. (e) Drugs\nA drug is a natural or synthetic/man-made substance that when taken changes/alter the body functioning. A natural or synthetic/man-made substance that when taken changes/alter the abnormal body functioning to normal is called medicine. Medicines are thus drugs intended to correct abnormal body functions. . Medicines should therefore be taken on prescription and dosage. A prescription is a medical instruction to a patient/sick on the correct type of medicine to take and period/time between one intake to the other. A dosage is the correct quantity of drug required to alter the abnormal body function back to normal. This is called treatment. It is the professional work of qualified doctors/pharmacists to administer correct prescription and dosage of drugs/medicine to the sick. Prescription and dosage of drugs/medicine to the sick use medical language. Example\n(i) 2 x 4 ; means “2” tablets for solid drugs/spoonfuls for liquid drugs taken “4” times for a duration of one day/24 hours and then repeated and continued until all the drug given is finished. (ii) 1 x 2 ; means “1” tablets for solid drugs/spoonfuls for liquid drugs taken “2” times for a duration of one day/24 hours and then repeated and continued until all the drug given is finished. Some drugs need minimal prescription and thus are available without pharmacist/ doctor’s prescription."
"Example\n(i) 2 x 4 ; means “2” tablets for solid drugs/spoonfuls for liquid drugs taken “4” times for a duration of one day/24 hours and then repeated and continued until all the drug given is finished. (ii) 1 x 2 ; means “1” tablets for solid drugs/spoonfuls for liquid drugs taken “2” times for a duration of one day/24 hours and then repeated and continued until all the drug given is finished. Some drugs need minimal prescription and thus are available without pharmacist/ doctor’s prescription. They are called Over The Counter (OTC) drugs. OTC drugs used to treat mild headaches, stomach upsets, common cold include:\n(i) Painkillers\n(ii) Anti-acids\n(iii) cold/flu drugs. All medicine requires correct intake dosage. When a prescription dosage is not followed, this is called drug misuse/abuse. Some drugs are used for other purposes other than that intended. This is called drug abuse. Drug abuse is when a drug is intentionally used to alter the normal functioning of the body. The intentional abnormal function of the drug is to make the victim have false feeling of well being. The victim lack both mental and physical coordination. Some drugs that induce a false feeling of well being are illegal. They include heroin, cocaine, bhang, Mandrax and morphine. Some abused drugs which are not illegal include: Miraa, alcohol, tobacco, sleeping pills. The role of chemistry in society\n(a) Chemistry is used in the following:\n(i) Washing/cleaning with soap:\nWashing/cleaning is a chemical process that involves interaction of water, soap and dirt so as to remove the dirt from a garment. (ii) Understanding chemicals of life\nLiving thing grow, respire and feed. The formation and growth of cells involve chemical processes in living things using carbohydrates, proteins and vitamins. (iii) Baking:\nAdding baking powder to dough and then heating in an oven involves interactions that require understanding of chemistry. (iv) Medicine:\nDiscovery, test, prescription and dosage of drugs to be used for medicinal purposes require advanced understanding of chemistry\n(v) Fractional distillation of crude oil:\nCrude oil is fractional distilled to useful portions like petrol, diesel, kerosene by applying chemistry. (vi) Manufacture of synthetic compounds/substances\nLarge amounts of plastics, glass, fertilizers, insecticides, soaps, cements, are manufactured worldwide."

Advanced understanding of the chemical processes involved is a requirement. (vii) Diagnosis/test for abnormal body functions. If the body is not functioning normally, it is said to be sick/ill. Laboratory test are done to diagnose the illness/sickness. (b) The following career fields require Chemistry as one of subject areas of advanced/specialized study:\n(i) Chemical engineering/chemical engineer\n(ii) Veterinary medicine/Veterinary doctor\n(iii) Medicine/Medical doctor/pharmacist/nurse\n(iv) Beauty/Beautician\n(v) Teaching/Chemistry teacher. The School Chemistry Laboratory\nChemistry is studied mainly in a science room called a school chemistry laboratory. The room is better ventilated than normal classroom. It has electricity, gas and water taps. A school chemistry laboratory has a qualified professional whose called Laboratory technician/assistant. All students user in a school chemistry laboratory must consult the Laboratory technician/assistant for all their laboratory work. A school chemistry laboratory has chemicals and apparatus. A chemical is a substance whose composition is known. All chemical are thus labeled as they are. This is because whereas physically a substance may appear similar, chemically they may be different. All Chemicals which are not labeled should never be used. Some chemicals are toxic/poisonous, explosive, corrosive, caustic, irritants, flammable, oxidizing, carcinogenic, or radioactive. Care should always be taken when handling any chemical which have any of the above characteristic properties."
"All Chemicals which are not labeled should never be used. Some chemicals are toxic/poisonous, explosive, corrosive, caustic, irritants, flammable, oxidizing, carcinogenic, or radioactive. Care should always be taken when handling any chemical which have any of the above characteristic properties. Common school chemistry laboratory chemicals include:\n(i) Distilled water\n(ii) Concentrated mineral acid which are very corrosive (on contact with skin they cause painful open wounds)\n(iii) Concentrated alkali/bases which are caustic (on contact with skin they cause painful blisters)\n(iv) Very many types of salts\nThe following safety guideline rules should be followed by chemistry laboratory users:\n(i) Enter the laboratory with permission in an orderly manner without rushing/pushing/scrabbling. (ii) Do not try unauthorized experiments. They may produce flammable, explosive or toxic substances that affect your health. (iii) Do not taste any chemical in the laboratory. They may be poisonous. (iv) Waft gas fumes to your nose with your palm. Do not inhale/smell gases directly. They may be highly poisonous/toxic. (v) Boil substances with mouth of the test tube facing away from others and yourself. Boiling liquids spurt out portions of the hot liquid. Products of heating solids may be a highly poisonous/toxic gas. (vi) Wash with lots of water any skin contact with chemicals immediately. Report immediately to teacher/laboratory technician any irritation, cut, burn, bruise or feelings arising from laboratory work. (vii) Read and follow safety instruction.

Wash your hand before leaving the chemistry laboratory. (ix) In case of fire, remain calm, switch of the source of fuel-gas tap. Leave the laboratory through the emergency door. Use fire extinguishers near the chemistry laboratory to put of medium fires. Leave strong fires wholly to professional fire fighters. (x) Do not carry unauthorized item from a chemistry laboratory. An apparator /apparatus are scientific tools/equipment used in performing scientific experiments. The conventional apparator used in performing scientific experiments is called standard apparator/apparatus. If the conventional standard apparator/apparatus is not available, an improvised apparator/apparatus may be used in performing scientific experiments."

The conventional apparator used in performing scientific experiments is called standard apparator/apparatus. If the conventional standard apparator/apparatus is not available, an improvised apparator/apparatus may be used in performing scientific experiments. An improvised apparator/apparatus is one used in performing a scientific experiment for a standard apparator/apparatus. Most standard apparatus in a school chemistry laboratory are made of glass because:\n(i)Glass is transparent and thus reactions /interactions inside are clearly visible from outside\n(ii) Glass is comparatively cheaper which reduces cost of equipping the school chemistry laboratory\n(iii) Glass is comparatively easy to clean/wash after use.(iv) Glass is comparatively unreactive to many chemicals.

"Beam balance\nA beam balance has a pan where a substance of unknown mass is placed. The scales on the opposite end are adjusted to “balance” with the mass of the unknown substance. The mass from a beam balance is in grams. 2. Electronic/electric balance. An electronic/electric balance has a pan where a substance of unknown mass is placed. The mass of the unknown substance in grams is available immediately on the screen. (c)Apparatus for measuring temperature\nA thermometer has alcohol or mercury trapped in a bulb with a thin enclosed outlet for the alcohol/mercury in the bulb. If temperature rises in the bulb, the alcohol /mercury expand along the thin narrow enclosed outlet. The higher the temperature, the more the expansion\nOutside, a calibration /graduation correspond to this expansion and thus changes in temperature. A thermometer therefore determines the temperature when the bulb is fully dipped in to the substance being tested. To determine the temperature of solid is thus very difficult. (d)Apparatus for measuring time\nThe stop watch/clock is the standard apparatus for measuring time. Time is measured using hours, minutes and second. Common school stop watch/clock has start, stop and reset button for determining time for a chemical reaction. This requires practice. (e) Apparatus for scooping\n1. Spatula\nA spatula is used to scoop solids which do not require accurate measurement. Both ends of the spatula can be used at a time. A solid scooped to the brim is “one spatula end full” A solid scooped to half brim is “half spatula end full”. 2. Deflagrating spoon\nA deflagrating spoon is used to scoop solids which do not require accurate measurement mainly for heating. Unlike a spatula, a deflagrating spoon is longer. (f) Apparatus for putting liquids/solid for heating. 1. Test tube. A test tube is a narrow/thin glass apparatus open on one side.

"(iv)The bench, tripod or clamp to support apparatus which cannot stand on their own should be shown. CLASSIFICATION OF SUBSTANCES\nSubstances are either pure or impure. A pure substance is one which contains only one substance. An impure substance is one which contains two or more substances. A pure substance is made up of a pure solid, pure liquid or pure gas. A mixture is a combination of two or more pure substances which can be separated by physical means. The three states of matter in nature appear mainly as mixtures of one with the other. Common mixtures include:\n(a)Solutions/solid-liquid dissolved mixture\nExperiment:\nTo make a solution of copper (II) sulphate (VI)/Potassium magnate(VII) /sodium chloride\nProcedure\nPut about 100 cm3 of water in three separate beakers.

Observation\nCopper (II) sulphate (VI) crystals dissolve to form a blue solution\nPotassium manganate (VII) crystals dissolve to form a purple solution\nSodium chloride crystals dissolve to form a colourless solution\nExplanation\nSome solids, liquids and gases dissolve in some other liquids. A substance/liquid in which another substance dissolves is called solvent. A substance /solid /gas which dissolves in a solvent is called solute. When a solute dissolves in a solvent it forms a uniform mixture called solution. A solute dissolved in water as the solvent exists in another state of matter called aqueous state. Water is referred as the universal solvent because it dissolves many solutes. A solute that dissolves in a solvent is said to be soluble. Soluble particles uniformly spread between the particles of water/solvent and cannot be seen. Solute + Solvent -> solution\nSolute + Water -> aqueous solution of solute\nThe solute dissolved in water gives the name of the solution e. g. 1. Sodium chloride solution is a solution formed after dissolving sodium chloride crystals/solid in water. Sodium chloride exists in aqueous state after dissolving. Sodium chloride + Water -> Sodium chloride solution\nNaCl(s) + (aq) -> NaCl(aq)\n2. Ammonia solution is a solution formed after dissolving ammonia gas in water."

They are said to be insoluble in the solvent .When an insoluble solid is put in liquid:\n(i) Some particles remain suspended/floating in the liquid to form a suspension /precipitate."
"Some soil, maize and lead (II) Iodide settle at the bottom after some time. Explanation\nSome solid substances do not dissolve in a liquid. They are said to be insoluble in the solvent .When an insoluble solid is put in liquid:\n(i) Some particles remain suspended/floating in the liquid to form a suspension /precipitate. (ii) Some particles sink/settle to the bottom to form sediments after being allowed to stand. An insoluble solid acquire the colour of the suspension/precipitate .e.g. 1.

"Measure 50cm3 of turpentine oil. Place the oil into the beaker containing water. Swirl for about one minute. (ii) Measure 50cm3 of water into 100cm3 beaker. Measure 50cm3 of kerosene. Place the kerosene into the beaker containing water. Swirl for about one minute. Observation\nTwo liquids form layers. Turpentine and water do not form a uniform mixture. Water and kerosene do not form uniform mixture\nExplanation\nKerosene is immiscible in Water. Water is immiscible in turpentine oil. Immiscible mixtures do not form uniform mixtures. They form layers. The size of the particles of one liquid is almost equal to the particles of the other. The particles of one liquid cannot occupy the spaces between the particles of the other. The heavier particles settle at the bottom. The less dense particles settle on top. (d)Solid-solid mixtures/Alloys\nBefore solidifying, some heated molten/liquid metals dissolve in another metal to form a uniform mixture of the two. On solidifying, a uniform mixture of the metals is formed. A uniform mixture of two metals on solidifying is called alloy. In the alloy, one metallic particle occupies the spaces between the metallic particles of the other. c) Common alloys of metal. METHODS OF SEPARATING MIXTURES\nMixtures can be separated from applying the following methods:\n(a) Decantation\nSediments can be separated from a liquid by pouring out the liquid. This process is called decantation. Experiment\nPut some sand in a beaker. Add about 200cm3 of water. Allow sand to settle. Pour off water carefully into another beaker. Observation\nSand settles at the bottom as sediments. Less clean water is poured out. Explanation\nSand does not dissolve in water. Sand is denser than water and thus settles at the bottom as sediment. When poured out, the less dense water flows out. (b)Filtration\nDecantation leaves suspended particles in the liquid after separation. Filtration is thus improved decantation.Filtration is the method of separating insoluble mixtures/particles/solids from a liquid. Experiment: To separate soil and water using filtration\nFold a filter paper to fit well into a filter funnel. Place the funnel in an empty 250 cm3 beaker."
"Filtration is thus improved decantation.Filtration is the method of separating insoluble mixtures/particles/solids from a liquid. Experiment: To separate soil and water using filtration\nFold a filter paper to fit well into a filter funnel. Place the funnel in an empty 250 cm3 beaker. Put one spatula end full of soil into 50cm3 of water. Stir. Put the soil/water mixture into the filter funnel. Observations\nClean water is collected below the filter funnel. Soil remains above the filter paper. Explanation\nA filter paper is porous which act like a fine sieve with very small holes. The holes allow smaller water particles to pass through but do not allow bigger soil particles. The liquid which passes through is called filtrate. The solid which do not pass through is called residue. Set up of apparatus\nIn industries, filtration is used in engine filters to clean up air. (c)Evaporation\nEvaporation is a method of separating a solute/solid from its solution. This involves heating a solution (solvent and solute)to vapourize the solvent out of the solution mixture leaving pure solute/solid. If a mixture contain insoluble solid, they are filtered out. Experiment: To separate a mixture of soil and salt (sodium chloride). Procedure:\nPut one spatula end full of soil on a filter paper. Put one spatula full of common salt/sodium chloride into the same filter paper. Mix well using the spatula,. Place about 200cm3 of water into a beaker. Put the contents of the filter paper into the water. Stir thoroughly using a glass/stirring rod for about one minute. Fold a filter paper into a filter funnel. Pour half portion of the contents in the beaker into the filter funnel. Put the filtrate into an evaporating dish. Heat on a water bath. Observation\n(i)On mixing\nColourless crystals and brown soil particles appear on the filter paper. (ii)On adding water\nCommon soil dissolves in water. Soil particles do not dissolve in water. (iii)On filtration\nColourless liquid collected as filtrate below the filter funnel/paper. Brown residue collected above the filter funnel/paper. (iv)On evaporation\nColourless crystals collected after evaporation\nExplanation\nSolid mixture of sand and common salt take the colors of the two. On adding water, common salt dissolves to form a solution."
"Brown residue collected above the filter funnel/paper. (iv)On evaporation\nColourless crystals collected after evaporation\nExplanation\nSolid mixture of sand and common salt take the colors of the two. On adding water, common salt dissolves to form a solution. Soil does not because it is insoluble in water and thus forms a suspension. On filtration, a residue of insoluble soil does not pass through the filter paper. It is collected as residue. Common salt solution is collected as filtrate. On heating the filtrate, the solvent/water evaporate/vaporize out of the evaporating dish leaving common salt crystals. Vapourization/evaporation can take place even without heating. This is the principle/process of drying wet clothes on the hanging line. Set up of apparatus\n(d) Distillation\nDistillation is an improved evaporation where both the solute and the solvent in the solution are separated /collected. Distillation therefore is the process of separating a solution into constituent solid solute and the solvent. It involves heating the solution to evaporate/vaporize the solvent out. The solvent vapour is then condensed back to a liquid. Experiment: To obtain copper (II) sulphate (VI) crystals and water from copper (II) sulphate (VI) solution. Procedure:\nPut one spatula end full of copper (II) sulphate (VI) crystals into a 250cm3 beaker. Place about 200cm3 of water into the beaker. Stir thoroughly using a glass/stirring rod for about one minute. Pour half portion of the contents in the beaker into a round bottomed/flat/conical flask broken porcelain/sand/glass into the flask. Put a few pieces of b Stopper the flask. Connect the flask to a Liebig condenser using delivery tube. Place a 200cm3 clean empty beaker/conical flask as a receiver at the end of the Liebig condenser. Circulate water in the Liebig condenser. Heat the flask strongly on a tripod stand with wire mesh/gauze until there is no more visible boiling bubbles in the flask. Observation\nCopper (II) sulphate (VI) crystals dissolve in water to form a blue solution.On heating, colourless liquid is collected in the receiver. Blue crystals are left in the flask."
"Heat the flask strongly on a tripod stand with wire mesh/gauze until there is no more visible boiling bubbles in the flask. Observation\nCopper (II) sulphate (VI) crystals dissolve in water to form a blue solution.On heating, colourless liquid is collected in the receiver. Blue crystals are left in the flask. (If gently heated further, the blue crystals turn to white powder)\nExplanation\nOn heating blue Copper (II) sulphate (VI) solution, the colourless liquid solvents evaporate/vaporize. The liquid vapour/gas passes through the delivery tube to the Liebig condenser. The Liebig condenser has a cold water inlet near the receiver and cold water out let. This ensures efficient cooling. If the cold water outlet/inlet is reversed, the water circulation would be less efficient. The water in the receiver would be warm. In the Liebig condenser, the cold water condenses the liquid vapour into liquid. The condensed liquid collects in the receiver as distillate. The solute of blue Copper (II) sulphate (VI) crystals is left in the flask as residue. During simple distillation, therefore, the solution is heated to vaporize /evaporate the solvent/one component which is condensed at a different part of the apparatus. The purpose of pieces of broken porcelain/porous pot/glass/sand/ is to:\n(i) Prevent bumping of the solution during boiling. (ii) Ensure smooth and even boiling. Salty sea water can be made pure through simple distillation. Any mixture with a large difference /40oC in boiling point can be separated using simple distillation. Set up of apparatus\ne)Fractional distillation\nFractional distillation is an improved simple distillation used specifically to separate miscible mixtures with very close /near boiling points. Fractional distillation involves:\n(i) Heating the mixture in a conical/round bottomed /flat bottomed flask. The pure substance with a lower boiling point and thus more volatile evaporates/boils/vaporize first.e.g. Pure ethanol has a boiling point of 78oC.Pure water has a boiling point of 100 oC at sea level/one atmosphere pressure. When a miscible mixture of ethanol and water is heated, ethanol vaporizes /boils/ evaporates first because it is more volatile. (ii)The conical/round bottomed /flat bottomed flask is connected to a long glass tube called fractionating column."
"Pure ethanol has a boiling point of 78oC.Pure water has a boiling point of 100 oC at sea level/one atmosphere pressure. When a miscible mixture of ethanol and water is heated, ethanol vaporizes /boils/ evaporates first because it is more volatile. (ii)The conical/round bottomed /flat bottomed flask is connected to a long glass tube called fractionating column. The purpose of the fractionating column is to offer areas of condensation for the less volatile pure mixture. The fractionating column is packed with glass beads/broken glass/ porcelain/ shelves to increase the surface area of condensation of the less volatile pure mixture. (iii)When the vapors rise they condense on the glass beads/broken glass /porcelain / shelves which become hot. When the temperature of the glass beads/broken glass/porcelain/shelves is beyond the boiling point of the less volatile pure substance, the pure substance rise and condensation take place on the glass beads/broken glass/porcelain/shelves at a higher level on the fractionating column. The less volatile pure substance trickles/drips back down the fractionating column or back into the conical/round bottomed /flat bottomed flask to be heated again. e.g. If the temperature on glass beads/broken glass/porcelain/shelves is beyond 78oC, the more volatile pure ethanol rise to condense on the glass beads/broken glass /porcelain/shelves higher in the fractionating column. Water condenses and then drip/trickle to the glass beads/broken glass /porcelain /shelves lower in the fractionating column because it is less volatile. (iv) The fractionating column is connected to a Liebig condenser. The Liebig condenser has a cold water inlet and outlet circulation. The more volatile mixture that reach the top of the fractionating column is condenses by the Liebig condenser into a receiver. It is collected as the first fraction. (v)At the top of the fractionating column, a thermometer is placed to note/monitor the temperature of the boiling mixtures. Pure substances have constant/fixed boiling point. When one mixture is completely separated, the thermometer reading rises. E.g. the thermometer reading remains at78oC when ethanol is being separated. When no more ethanol is being separated, the mercury/alcohol level in the thermometer rises."
"E.g. the thermometer reading remains at78oC when ethanol is being separated. When no more ethanol is being separated, the mercury/alcohol level in the thermometer rises. (vi)The second /subsequent fractions are collected in the receiver after noting a rise the mercury/alcohol level in the thermometer. E.g. the thermometer reading rises to 100oC when water is being separated. It is passed through the Liebig condenser with the cold water inlet and outlet circulation. It is collected different receiver as the second/subsequent fraction. (vii)Each fraction collected should be confirmed from known physical/chemical properties/characteristic. Example\nEthanol\nEthanol is a colourless liquid that has a characteristic smell .When it is put in a watch glass then ignited, it catches fire and burn with a blue flame. Water\nWater is a colourless liquid that has no smell/odour .When it is put in a watch glass then ignited, it does not catch fire. Set up of apparatus\nIndustrial application of Fractional distillation\nOn a large scale,fractional distillation is used:\n(i)In fractional distillation of crude oil in an oil refinery. Crude oil is a mixture of many fractions. When heated in a furnace, the different fractions separate out according to their boiling point. In Kenya,fractional distillation takes place at Changamwe in Mombasa. (ii)In fractional distillation of air. Air contain a mixture of three main useful gases which are condensed by cooling to very low temperature (-200oC) to form a liquid. The liquid is then heated. Nitrogen is the most volatile (-196 oC) and thus comes out as the first fraction. Argon (at -186 oC) is the second fraction. Oxygen ( at -183 oC) is the last fraction. The three gases are very useful industrial gases. (f)Separation of immiscibles (Using a separating funnel)\nTwo or more liquids that form layers on mixing are immiscible. Immiscible mixture arrange themselves according to their densities\ni.e. The denser liquid sink to the bottom. The less dense liquid floats on the denser one. Immicible mixtures can be separated from each other by using a separating funnel. Experiment: To separate an immiscible mixture of paraffin and water. Procedure\nPlace about 100cm3 of water into a 250cm3 beaker."
"Immicible mixtures can be separated from each other by using a separating funnel. Experiment: To separate an immiscible mixture of paraffin and water. Procedure\nPlace about 100cm3 of water into a 250cm3 beaker. Add about 100cm3 of paraffin into the beaker. Stir. Transfer the mixture into a separating funnel. Allow to settle for about one minute. Open the tap, run out the lower layer out slowly into a clean beaker. Close the tap when the upper layer is very close to the tap. Run out the intermediate small amount of the mixture near the tap into a beaker. Discard it. Run out the remaining upper layer into a fresh beaker. Place a portion of upper and lower layer into a watch glass separately after separating each. Ignite. Observation\nWater and paraffin are both colourless liquids. Two layers are formed on mixing. Colourless odorless liquid collected first. It does not catch fire. A colourless liquid with characteristic smell collected later/second. It catches fire and burn with a yellow smoky flame. Explanation\nWater and paraffin are immiscible. Water is denser than paraffin. When put in a separating funnel, paraffin float on water. On opening the tap, water runs out. A mixture of water and paraffin at the junction of the two is discarded. It is not pure. Set up of apparatus\n(g)Sublimation/deposition\nSome solids on heating do not melt to a liquid but change directly to a gas. The process by which a solid changes to a gas is called sublimation. The gas cools back and changes directly to a solid. The process by which a gas changes to a solid is called deposition. Sublimation and deposition therefore are the same but opposite processes. Sublimation Deposition\nSome common substances that undergo sublimation/ deposition include:\n(i)Iodine(ii)Carbon(IV)oxide (iii)Camphor (iv) ammonium chloride(v)Iron(III)chloride (vi)Aluminum(III)chloride\n(vii) benzoic acid\nIf a mixture has any of the above as a component, then on heating it will change to a gas and be deposited away from the source of heating. Procedure\nPlace about one spatula full of ammonium chloride crystals into a clean dry 100cm3 beaker."

Procedure\nPlace about one spatula full of ammonium chloride crystals into a clean dry 100cm3 beaker. Add equal amount of sodium chloride crystals into the beaker. Swirl to mix. Place the beaker on a tripod stand. Put about 100cm3 of water into another beaker. Place carefully the beaker containing water on top of the beaker containing the solid mixture. Light/ignite a burner and heat the solid. Set up of apparatus:\nObservation\n(i)With ammonium chloride/common salt mixture\nWhite fumes produced. White sublimate deposited\nColourless residue left\n(ii)With Iodine/common salt mixture\nPurple fumes produced. Dark grey sublimate deposited\nColourless residue left\nExplanation\n(i)On heating a mixture of ammonium chloride and common salt, a white fume of ammonium chloride is produced. The white fumes solidify as white sublimate on the cooler parts. Common salt remains as residue. Chemical equation:\nAmmonium chloride solid Ammonium chloride gas\nNH4Cl(s) NH4Cl(g)\n(ii)On heating a mixture of Iodine and common salt, a purple fume of Iodine vapour is produced. The purple fumes solidify as dark grey sublimate on the cooler parts. Common salt remains as residue. Chemical equation:\nIodine solid Iodine gas\nI2(s) I2 (g)\n(h)Chromatography\nChromatography is a method of separating components of a solution mixture by passing it through a medium where the different components move at different rates. The medium through which the solution mixture is passed is called absorbent material. Paper chromatography is a method of separating colored dyes by using paper as the absorbent material. Since dyes are insoluble/do not dissolve in water, ethanol and propanone are used as suitable solvents for dissolving the dye."
"The medium through which the solution mixture is passed is called absorbent material. Paper chromatography is a method of separating colored dyes by using paper as the absorbent material. Since dyes are insoluble/do not dissolve in water, ethanol and propanone are used as suitable solvents for dissolving the dye. Practically, a simple paper chromatography involve placing a dye/material on the absorbent material, adding slowly a suitable soluble solvent on the dye/material using a dropper, the solvent spread out on the absorbent material carrying the soluble dye away from the origin. The spot on which the dye is initially/originally placed is called baseline. The farthest point the solvent spread is called solvent front. The farthest a dye can be spread by the solvent depend on:\n(i) Density of the dye-the denser the dye, the less it spread from the basely ne by the solvent. (ii) Stickiness of the dye-some dyes sticks on the absorbent material more than other thus do not spread far from baseline. Experiment: To investigate the colors in ink\nProcedure\nMethod 1\nPlace a filter paper on an empty beaker. Put a drop of black/blue ink in the centre of the filter paper. Wait for about one minute for the ink drop to spread. Using a clean teat pipette/dropper add one drop of ethanol/propanone. Wait for about one minute for the ink drop to spread further. Add about twenty other drops of ethanol waiting for about one minute before each addition. Allow the filter paper to dry. Experiment: To investigate the colors in ink\nProcedure\nMethod 2\nCut an 8 centimeter thin strip of a filter paper. At about 3cm on the strip, place a drop of ink. Place the filter paper in a 10cm length boiling tube containing 5cm3 of ethanol. Ensure the cut strip of the filter paper just dips into the ethanol towards the ink mark. Cover the boiling tube. Wait for about twenty minutes. Remove the boiling tube and allow the filter paper to dry. Set up of apparatus\nMethod 1\nSet up of apparatus\nMethod 2\nExplanation\nWhen a drop of ink is placed on an absorbent material it sticks. On adding an eluting solvent, it dissolves the dye spread out with it. The denser and sticky pure dye move least. The least dense/sticky pure dye move farthest."
"On adding an eluting solvent, it dissolves the dye spread out with it. The denser and sticky pure dye move least. The least dense/sticky pure dye move farthest. A pure dye will produce the same chromatogram/spot if the same eluting solvent is used on the same absorbent material. Comparing the distance moved by a pure dye with a mixture, the coloured dyes in a mixture can be deduced as below:\nExample 1\nThe chromatogram of pure dyes A, B ,C and a dye mixture D is shown below Determine the pure dyes present in D. On the diagram show:\n(i)the solvent front\n(ii) Baseline\n(Iii) the most soluble pure dye\n(i) Solvent extraction\nSolvent extraction is a method of separating oil from nuts/seeds. Most nuts contain oil. First the nuts are crushed to reduce their size and increase the surface area. A suitable volatile solvent is added. The mixture is filtered. The filtrate solvent is then allowed to crystallize leaving the oil/fat. If a filter paper is rubbed/smeared with the oil/fat, it becomes translucent. This is the test for the presence of oil/fat. Experiment: To extract oil from Macadamia nut seeds\nProcedure\nCrush Macadamia nut seeds form the hard outer cover .Place the inner soft seed into a mortar. Crush (add a little sand to assist in crushing). Add a little propanone and continue crushing. Continue crushing and adding a little propanone until there is more liquid mixture than the solid. Decant/filter. Put the filtrate into an evaporating dish. Vapourize the solvent using solar energy /sunlight. Smear/rub a portion of the residue left after evaporation on a clean dry filter paper. Observation /Explanation\nPropanone dissolve fat/oil in the macadamia nuts. Propanone is more volatile (lower boiling point) than oil/fat. In sunlight/solar energy, propanone evaporate/vaporize leaving oil/fat(has a higher boiling point).Any seed like corn, wheat , rice, soya bean may be used instead of macadamia seed. When oil/fat is rubbed/ smeared on an opaque paper, it becomes translucent."

When oil/fat is rubbed/ smeared on an opaque paper, it becomes translucent. (j) Crystallization\nCrystallization is the process of using solubility of a solute/solid to obtain the solute/solid crystals from a saturated solution by cooling or heating the solution. A crystal is the smallest regular shaped particle of a solute. Every solute has unique shape of its crystals. Some solutions form crystals when heated. This is because less solute dissolves at higher temperature. Some other solutions form crystals when cooled. This is because less solute dissolves at lower temperature. Experiment; To crystallize copper (II) sulphate (VI) solution\nProcedure:\nPlace about one spatula full of hydrated copper sulphate (VI) crystals into 200cm3 of distilled water in a beaker. Stir. Continue adding a little more of the hydrated copper sulphate (VI) crystals and stirring until no more dissolve. Decant/filter. Cover the filtrate with a filter paper. Pierce and make small holes on the filter paper cover. Preserve the experiment for about seven days. Observation/Explanation\nLarge blue crystals formed\nWhen hydrated copper (II) sulphate crystals are placed in water, they dissolve to form copper (II) sulphate solution. After some days water slowly evaporate leaving large crystals of copper (II) sulphate. If the mixture is heated to dryness, small crystals are formed. Physical/Temporary and Chemical changes\nA physical/temporary change is one which no new substance is formed and is reversible back to original. A chemical/permanent change is one which a new substance is formed and is irreversible back to original. The following experiments illustrates physical and chemical changes\n(a)Heating ice\nPlace about 10g of pure ice in a beaker. Determine its temperature. Record it at time “0.0” in the table below."
"The following experiments illustrates physical and chemical changes\n(a)Heating ice\nPlace about 10g of pure ice in a beaker. Determine its temperature. Record it at time “0.0” in the table below. Heat the ice on a strong Bunsen flame and determine its temperature after every 60seconds/1minute to complete the table below:\nPlot a graph of time against Temperature (y-axes)\nExplain the shape of your graph\nMelting/freezing/fusion/solidification and boiling /vaporization /evaporation are the two physical processes. Melting /freezing point of pure substances is fixed /constant. The boiling point of pure substance depends on external atmospheric pressure. Melting/fusion is the physical change of a solid to liquid. Freezing is the physical change of a liquid to solid. Melting/freezing/fusion/solidification is therefore two opposite but same reversible physical processes i.e. A (s) A (l)\nBoiling/vaporization/evaporation is the physical change of a liquid to gas. Condensation/ liquidification is the physical change of gas to liquid. Boiling/vaporization/evaporation and condensation/ liquidification are therefore two opposite but same reversible physical processes i.e. B (l) B(g)\nPractically\n(i) Melting/liquidification/fusion involves heating a solid to weaken the strong bonds holding the solid particles together. Solids are made up of very strong bonds holding the particles very close to each other (Kinetic Theory of matter). On heating these particles gain energy/heat from the surrounding heat source to form a liquid with weaker bonds holding the particles close together but with some degree of freedom. (ii)Freezing/fusion/solidification involves cooling a liquid to reform /rejoin the very strong bonds to hold the particles very close to each other as solid and thus lose their degree of freedom (Kinetic Theory of matter). Freezing /fusion / solidification is an exothermic (-∆H) process that require particles holding the liquid together to lose energy to the surrounding. (iii)Boiling/vaporization/evaporation involves heating a liquid to completely break/free the bonds holding the liquid particles together. Gaseous particles have high degree of freedom (Kinetic Theory of matter). Boiling /vaporization / evaporation is an endothermic (+∆H) process that require/absorb energy from the surrounding."

Gaseous particles have high degree of freedom (Kinetic Theory of matter). Boiling /vaporization / evaporation is an endothermic (+∆H) process that require/absorb energy from the surrounding. (iv)Condensation/liquidification is reverse process of boiling /vaporization / evaporation. It involves gaseous particles losing energy to the surrounding to form a liquid. AIR OXYGEN AND COMBUSTION\nA.THE ATMOSPHERE\n1. The atmosphere is made up of air. Air is a mixture of colourless, odorless gases which is felt as wind (air in motion).All living things breath in air for respiration. Plants use air for respiration and photosynthesis. 2. The main gases present in the atmosphere/air:\n3. The following experiments below shows the presence and composition of the gases in air/atmosphere\n(a)To find the composition of air supporting combustion using a candle stick\nProcedure\nMeasure the length of an empty gas jar M1. Place a candle stick on a Petri dish. Float it on water in basin/trough. Cover it with the gas jar. Mark the level of the water in the gas jar M2. Remove the gas jar. Light the candle sick. Carefully cover it with the gas jar. Observe for two minutes. Mark the new level of the water M3. Set up of apparatus\nSample observations\nCandle continues to burn then extinguished/goes off\nLevel of water in the gas jar rises after igniting the candle\nLength of empty gas jar = M1= 14cm\nLength of gas jar without water before igniting candle = M2= 10 cm\nLength of gas jar with water before igniting candle = M1 - M2= 14- 10 = 4 cm\nLength of gas jar with water after igniting candle = M3 = 8 cm\nLength of gas jar without water after igniting candle = M1 - M3 = 10 -8 = 2 cm\nExplanation\nCandle burns in air. In a closed system (vessel), the candle continues to burn using the part of air that support burning/combustion. This is called the active part of air. The candle goes off/extinguished when all the active part of air is used up."
"In a closed system (vessel), the candle continues to burn using the part of air that support burning/combustion. This is called the active part of air. The candle goes off/extinguished when all the active part of air is used up. The level of the water rises to occupy the space /volume occupied by the used active part of air. The experiment is better when very dilute sodium/potassium hydroxide is used instead of water. Dilute Potassium/ sodium hydroxide absorb Carbon (IV) oxide gas that comes out from burning/combustion of candle stick. From the experiment above the % composition of the:\n(i) Active part of air can be calculated:\nM2 - M3 x 100% =>10- 8 x 100% = 20%\nM2 10cm\n(ii) Inactive part of air can be calculated:\n100% -20% = 80% // M3 => 8 x 100% = 80%\nM2 10cm\n(b)To find the composition of active part of air using heated copper turnings. Procedure\nClamp a completely packed/filled open ended glass tube with copper turnings. Seal the ends with glass/cotton wool. Label two graduated syringes as “A” and “B” Push out air from syringe “A”. Pull in air into syringe “B”. Attach both syringe “A” and “B” on opposite ends of the glass tube. Determine and record the volume of air in syringe “B” V1. Heat the glass tube strongly for about three minutes. Push all the air slowly from syringe “B” to syringe “A” as heating continues. Push all the air slowly from syringe “A” back to syringe “B” and repeatedly back and forth. After about ten minutes, determine the new volume of air in syringe “B” V2\nSet up of apparatus\nSample observations\nColour change from brown to black\nVolume of air in syringe “B” before heating V1 = 158.0cm3\nVolume of air in syringe “B” after heating V2 = 127.2cm3\nVolume of air in syringe “B” used by copper V1 - V2 = 30.8cm3\nSample questions\n1."

State and explain the observations made in the glass tube. Colour change from brown to black\nBrown copper metal reacts with the active part of air/oxygen to form black copper (II) oxide. Chemical equation\nCopper + Oxygen -> Copper (II) oxide\n2Cu(s) + O2 (g) -> 2CuO(s)\nThe reaction reduces the amount/volume of oxygen in syringe “B” leaving the inactive part of air. Copper only react with oxygen when heated. 3. Calculate the % of\n(i) Active part of air\n% active part of air = V1 - V2 x 100% =>30.8cm3 x 100% = 19.493%\nV1 158.0cm3\n(ii) Inactive part of air\nMethod 1\n% inactive part of air = V2 x 100% =>127.2cm3 x 100% = 80.506%\nV1 158.0cm3\nMethod 2\n% inactive part of air = 100% -% active part of air\n=> 100 % - 19.493 % = 80.507%\n4.

If the copper turnings are replaced with magnesium shavings the % of active part of air obtained is extraordinary very high. Explain. Magnesium is more reactive than copper. The reaction is highly exothermic. It generates enough heat for magnesium to react with both oxygen and nitrogen in the air. A white solid/ash mixture of Magnesium oxide and Magnesium nitride is formed. This considerably reduces the volume of air left after the experiment.

A metal/element with higher affinity for oxygen removes Oxygen from a metal lower in the reactivity series/less affinity for Oxygen. When a metal/element gains/acquire Oxygen, the process is called Oxidation. When metal/element donate/lose Oxygen, the process is called Reduction.

Pure water does not exist in nature but naturally in varying degree of purity. The main sources of water include rain, springs, borehole, lakes, seas and oceans:\nWater is generally used for the following purposes:\n(i) Drinking by animals and plants. (ii) Washing clothes. (iii) Bleaching and dyeing. (iv) Generating hydroelectric power. (v) Cooling industrial processes."
"(iii) Bleaching and dyeing. (iv) Generating hydroelectric power. (v) Cooling industrial processes. Water dissolves many substances/solutes. It is therefore called universal solvent. It contains about 35% dissolved Oxygen which support aquatic fauna and flora. Water naturally exists in three phases/states solid ice, liquid water and gaseous water vapour. The three states of water are naturally interconvertible. The natural interconvertion of the three phases/states of water forms the water cycle. Precipitation\nLiquid water in land, lakes, seas and oceans use the solar/sun energy to evaporate/vapourize to form water vapour/gas. Solar/sun energy is also used during transpiration by plants and respiration by animals. During evaporation, the water vapour rises up the earth’s surface. Temperatures decrease with height above the earth surface increase. Water vapour therefore cools as it rises up. At a height where it is cold enough to below 373Kelvin/100oC Water vapour looses enough energy to form tiny droplets of liquid. The process by which a gas/water vapour changes to a liquid is called condensation/liquidification. On further cooling, the liquid looses more energy to form ice/solid. The process by which a liquid/water changes to a ice/solid is called freezing/solidification. Minute/tiny ice/solid particles float in the atmosphere and coalesce/join together to form clouds. When the clouds become too heavy they fall to the earth’s surface as rain/snow as the temperature increase with the fall. Interconversion of the three phases/states water\nEvaporationLiquidification/\n/boiling/Vapourization condensation\nMelting Freezing liquidification\nSolidification\nPure water has:\n(i) fixed/constant/sharp freezing point/melting point of 273K/0oC\n(ii) fixed/constant/sharp boiling point of 373K/100oC at sea level/1 atmosphere pressure\n(iii) fixed density of 1gcm-3\nThis is the criteria of identifying pure/purity of water. Whether a substance is water can be determined by using the following methods:\na) To test for presence of water using anhydrous copper (II) suphate (VI)\nProcedure\nPut about 2g of anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (VI) crystals into a clean test tube."

Carbon (IV) oxide gas is also produced if the air is sufficient/excess. Procedure\nPut about 2g of anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (VI) crystals in a boiling tube. Put about 5cm3 of lime water in a boiling tube. Light a small candle stick. Place it below an inverted thistle/filter funnel\nCollect the products of the burning candle by setting the apparatus as below\nSet up of apparatus\nObservation\nThe sanction pump pulls the products of burning into the inverted funnel.

"Explanation\nWhen a candle burn it forms a water and carbon (IV) oxide. Water turns anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (VI) changes from white to blue. Carbon (IV) oxide gas forms white precipitate when bubbled in lime water/calcium hydroxide. Since:\n(i) hydrogen in the wax burn to form water\nHydrogen + Oxygen -> Water\n(from candle) (from the air)\n2H2 (g) + O2 (g) ->2H2O (g/l)\n(ii) carbon in the wax burn to form carbon (IV) oxide\nHydrogen + Oxygen -> Water\n(from candle) (from the air)\nC(s) + O2(g) ->CO2 (g)\nThe candle before burning therefore contained only Carbon and Hydrogen only. A compound made up of hydrogen and carbon is called Hydrocarbon. A candle is a hydrocarbon. Other hydrocarbons include: Petrol, diesel, Kerosene, and Laboratory gas. Hydrocarbons burn in air to form water and carbon (IV) oxide gas. Hydrocarbons + Oxygen -> Water + Oxygen\nWater pollution\nWater pollution takes place when undesirable substances are added into the water. Sources of water pollution include:\n(i)Industrial chemicals being disposed into water bodies like rivers, lakes and oceans. (ii)Discharging untreated /raw sewage into water bodies. (iii)Leaching of insecticides/herbicides form agricultural activities into water bodies. (iv)Discharging non-biodegradable detergents after domestic and industrial use into water bodies. (v)Petroleum oil spilling by ships and oil refineries\n(vi)Toxic/poisonous gases from industries dissolving in rain. (vii) Acidic gases from industries dissolving in rain to form “acid rain”\n(viii)Discharging hot water into water bodies. This reduces the quantity of dissolved Oxygen in the water killing the aquatic fauna and flora. Water pollution can be reduced by:\n(i) Reducing the use of agricultural fertilizers and chemicals in agricultural activities. (ii) Use of biological control method instead of insecticides and herbicides\n(iii) Using biodegradable detergents\nREACTION OF WATER WITH METALS. Some metals react with water while others do not. The reaction of metals with water depends on the reactivity series."
"(ii) Use of biological control method instead of insecticides and herbicides\n(iii) Using biodegradable detergents\nREACTION OF WATER WITH METALS. Some metals react with water while others do not. The reaction of metals with water depends on the reactivity series. The higher the metal in the reactivity series the more reactive the metal with water .The following experiments shows the reaction of metals with cold water and water vapour/steam. (a)Reaction of sodium/ potassium with cold water:\nProcedure\nPut about 500cm3 of water in a beaker. Add three drops of phenolphthalein indicator/litmus solution/universal indicator solution/methyl orange indicator into the water.

Effervescence/fizzing/ bubbles of colourless gas produced. Colour of phenolphthalein turns pink\nColour of litmus solution turns blue\nColour of methyl orange solution turns Orange\nColour of universal indicator solution turns blue\nExplanation\nSodium is less dense than water. Sodium floats on water and vigorously reacts to form an alkaline solution of sodium hydroxide and producing hydrogen gas. Sodium is thus stored in paraffin to prevent contact with water. Chemical equation\nSodium + Water -> Sodium hydroxide + Hydrogen gas\n2Na(s)+ 2H2O (l)-> 2NaOH (aq) + H2(g)\nTo collect hydrogen gas, Sodium metal is forced to sink to the bottom of the trough/beaker by wrapping it in wire gauze/mesh. Potassium is more reactive than Sodium. On contact with water it explodes/burst into flames. An alkaline solution of potassium hydroxide is formed and hydrogen gas\nChemical equation\nPotassium + Water -> Potassium hydroxide + Hydrogen gas\n2K(s)+ 2H2O (l)-> 2KOH (aq) + H2(g)\nCaution: Reaction of Potassium with water is very risky to try in a school laboratory.

"Hydrogen cannot be prepared from reaction of:\n(i)Nitric (V) acid and a metal. Nitric (V) acid is a strong oxidizing agent. It oxidizes hydrogen gas to water. (ii) Dilute sulphuric (VI) acid with calcium/Barium/Lead because Calcium sulphate (VI), Barium sulphate (VI) and Lead (II) sulphate (VI) salts formed are insoluble. Once formed, they cover/coat the unreacted calcium/Barium/Lead stopping further reaction and producing very small amount/volume of hydrogen gas. (iii) Dilute acid with sodium/potassium. The reaction is explosive. Properties of Hydrogen gas\n(a)Physical properties\n1. Hydrogen is a neutral, colourless and odorless gas. When mixed with air it has a characteristic pungent choking smell\n2. It is insoluble in water thus can be collected over water. 3. It is the lightest known gas. It can be transferred by inverting one gas jar over another. (b)Chemical properties\n(i)Burning\nI. Hydrogen does not support burning/combustion. When a burning splint is inserted into a gas jar containing Hydrogen, the flame is extinguished /put off. II. Pure dry hydrogen burn with a blue quiet flame to form water. When a stream of pure dry hydrogen is ignited, it catches fire and continues to burn with a blue flame. III. Impure (air mixed with) hydrogen burns with an explosion. Small amount/ volume of air mixed with hydrogen in a test tube produce a small explosion as a “pop” sound. This is the confirmatory test for the presence of Hydrogen gas. A gas that burns with a “pop” sound is confirmed to be Hydrogen. (ii)Redox in terms of Hydrogen transfer\nRedox can also be defined in terms of Hydrogen transfer. (i)Oxidation is removal of Hydrogen\n(ii)Reduction is addition of Hydrogen\n(iii)Redox is simultaneous addition and removal of Hydrogen\nExample\nWhen a stream of dry hydrogen gas is passed through black copper (II) oxide, hydrogen gas gains the oxygen from copper (II) oxide. Black copper (II) oxide is reduced to brown copper metal. Black copper (II) oxide thus the Oxidizing agent. Hydrogen gas is oxidized to Water. Hydrogen is the Reducing agent."

Oxygen + Hydrogen -> Water\nO2 (g) + 2H2 (g) -> 2H2O (l)\n(iii) Water as an Oxide as Hydrogen\nBurning is a reaction of an element with Oxygen. The substance formed when an element burn in air is the oxide of the element. When hydrogen burns, it reacts/ combines with Oxygen to form the oxide of Hydrogen. The oxide of Hydrogen is called water. Hydrogen is first dried because a mixture of Hydrogen and air explode. The gas is then ignited .The products condense on a cold surface/flask containing a freezing mixture. A freezing mixture is a mixture of water and ice. The condensed products are collected in a receiver as a colourless liquid."
"The gas is then ignited .The products condense on a cold surface/flask containing a freezing mixture. A freezing mixture is a mixture of water and ice. The condensed products are collected in a receiver as a colourless liquid. Tests\n(a) When about 1g of white anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (VI) is added to a sample of the liquid, it turns to blue. This confirms the liquid formed is water. (b) When blue anhydrous cobalt (II) chloride paper is dipped in a sample of the liquid, it turns to pink. This confirms the liquid formed is water. (c)When the liquid is heated to boil, its boiling point is 100oC at sea level/one atmosphere pressure. This confirms the liquid is pure water. Uses of Hydrogen gas\n1. Hydrogenation/Hardening of unsaturated vegetable oils to saturated fats/margarine. When Hydrogen is passed through unsaturated compounds in presence of Nickel catalyst and about 150oC, they become saturated. Most vegetable oil is unsaturated liquids at room temperature. They become saturated and hard through hydrogenation. 2. In weather forecast balloons. Hydrogen is the lightest known gas. Meteorological data is collected for analysis by sending hydrogen filled weather balloons to the atmosphere. The data collected is then used to forecast weather conditions. 3. In the Haber process for the manufacture of Ammonia\nHydrogen is mixed with Nitrogen in presence of Iron catalyst to form Ammonia gas. Ammonia gas is a very important raw material for manufacture of agricultural fertilizers. 4. In the manufacture of Hydrochloric acid. Limited volume/amount of Hydrogen is burnt in excess chlorine gas to form Hydrogen chloride gas. Hydrogen chloride gas is dissolved in water to form Hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is used in pickling/washing metal surfaces. 5. As rocket fuel. Fixed proportions of Hydrogen and Oxygen when ignited explode violently producing a lot of energy/heat. This energy is used to power/propel a rocket to space. 6. In oxy-hydrogen flame for welding. A cylinder containing Hydrogen when ignited in pure Oxygen from a second cylinder produces a flame that is very hot. It is used to cut metals and welding. Sample revision questions\n1. A colourless liquid was added anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (VI) which turned blue."

In a school laboratory:\n(i)An acid may be defined as a substance that turns litmus red. (ii)A base may be defined as a substance that turns litmus blue. Litmus is lichen found mainly in West Africa. It changes its colour depending on whether the solution it is in, is basic/alkaline or acidic. It is thus able to identify/show whether another substance is an acid, base or neutral. (iii)An indicator is a substance that shows whether another substance is a base/alkaline,acid or neutral. 2. Common naturally occurring acids include:\n3. Most commonly used acids found in a school laboratory are not naturally occurring. They are manufactured. They are called mineral acids. Common mineral acids include:\n4. Mineral acids are manufactured to very high concentration."
"They are called mineral acids. Common mineral acids include:\n4. Mineral acids are manufactured to very high concentration. They are corrosive (causes painful wounds on contact with the skin) and attack/reacts with garments/clothes/metals. In a school laboratory, they are mainly used when added a lot of water. This is called diluting. Diluting ensures the concentration of the acid is safely low. 5. Bases are opposite of acids. Most bases do not dissolve in water. Bases which dissolve in water are called alkalis. Common alkalis include:\nCommon bases (which are not alkali) include:\n6. Indicators are useful in identifying substances which look-alike. An acid-base indicator is a substance used to identify whether another substance is alkaline or acidic. An acid-base indicator works by changing to different colors in neutral, acidic and alkaline solutions/dissolved in water. Experiment: To prepare simple acid-base indicator\nProcedure\n(a)Place some flowers petals in a mortar. Crush them using a pestle. Add a little sand to assist in crushing. Add about 5cm3 of propanone/ethanol and carefully continue grinding. Add more 5cm3 of propanone/ethanol and continue until there is enough extract in the mortar. Filter the extract into a clean 100cm3 beaker. (b)Place 5cm3 of filtered wood ash, soap solution, ammonia solution, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, distilled water, sulphuric (VI) acid, sour milk, sodium chloride, toothpaste and calcium hydroxide into separate test tubes. (c)Put about three drops of the extract in (a)to each test tube in (b). Record the observations made in each case. Sample observations\nThe plant extract is able to differentiate between solutions by their nature. It is changing to a similar colour for similar solutions. (i)Since lemon juice is a known acid, then sulphuric (VI) and hydrochloric acids are similar in nature with lemon juice because the indicator shows similar colors. They are acidic in nature. (ii)Since sodium hydroxide is a known base/alkali, then the green colour of indicator shows an alkaline/basic solution. (iii) Since pure water is neutral, then the orange colour of indicator shows neutral solutions. 7. In a school laboratory, commercial indicators are used. A commercial indicator is cheap, readily available and easy to store."
"7. In a school laboratory, commercial indicators are used. A commercial indicator is cheap, readily available and easy to store.

Sample results\nFrom the table above, then the colour of indicators in different solution can be summarized. The universal indicator\nThe universal indicator is a mixture of other indicator dyes. The indicator uses the pH scale. The pH scale shows the strength of bases and acids. The pH scale ranges from 1-14.These numbers are called pH values:\n(i) pH values 1, 2, 3 shows a substance is strongly acid\n(ii) pH values 4, 5, 6 shows a substance is a weakly acid\n(iii) pH value 7 shows a substance is a neutral\n(iv) pH values 8, 9, 10, 11 shows a substance is a weak base/alkali. (v) pH values 12, 13, 14 shows a substance is a strong base/alkali\nThe pH values are determined from a pH chart. The pH chart is a multicolored paper with each colour corresponding to a pH value.i.e\n(i) red correspond to pH 1, 2, 3 showing strongly acidic solutions. (ii)Orange/ yellow correspond to pH 4, 5, 6 showing weakly acidic solutions. (iii)Green correspond to pH 7 showing neutral solutions. (iv)Blue correspond to pH 8, 9, 10, 11 showing weakly alkaline solutions. (v)Purple/dark blue correspond to pH 12,13,14 showing strong alkalis. The universal indicator is available as:\n(i) Universal indicator paper/pH paper\n(ii) Universal indicator solution. When determining the pH of a unknown solution using\n(i) pH paper then the pH paper is dipped into the unknown solution. It changes/turn to a certain colour. The new colour is marched/compared to its corresponding one on the pH chart to get the pH value."

Sample observations\n(i) effervescence/bubbles produced/fizzing in all cases except when using copper\n(ii) Colourless gas produced in all cases except when using copper\n(iii) Gas produced extinguishes a burning wooden splint with an explosion/pop sound. Explanation\nSome metals react with dilute acids, while others do not. Metals which react with acids produce bubbles of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas is a colourless gas that extinguishes a burning splint with a pop sound. This shows acids contain hydrogen gas. This hydrogen is displaced/removed from the acids by some metals like Magnesium, Zinc, aluminium, iron and sodium. Some other metals like copper, silver, gold; platinum and mercury are not reactive enough to displace/remove the hydrogen from dilute acids. Chemical equations\n1.

Neutralization by bases/alkalis\nAll acids react with bases to form a salt and water only. The reaction of an acid with metal oxides/hydroxides (bases) to salt and water only is called neutralization reaction. Since no effervescence/bubbling/fizzing take place during neutralization:\n(i) The reaction with alkalis requires a suitable indicator. The colour of the indicator changes when all the acid has reacted with the soluble solution of the alkali (metal oxides/ hydroxides). (ii) Excess of the base is added to ensure all the acid reacts. The excess acid is then filtered off. Experiment 1: reaction of alkali with mineral acids. (i)Place about 5cm3 of dilute hydrochloric acid in a boiling tube. Add one drop of phenolphthalein indicator. Using a dropper/teat pipette, add dilute sodium hydroxide dropwise until there is a colour change.

"In industries electrolysis has the following uses/applications:\n(a)Extraction of reactive metals from their ores\nPotassium, sodium, magnesium, and aluminum are extracted from their ores using electrolytic methods. (b)Purifying copper after extraction from copper pyrites ores\nCopper obtained from copper pyrites ores is not pure. After extraction, the copper is refined by electrolyzing copper (II) sulphate (VI) solution using the impure copper as anode and a thin strip of pure copper as cathode. Electrode ionization takes place there:\n(i)At the cathode; Cu2+ (aq) + 2e -> Cu(s) (Pure copper deposits on the strip\n(ii)At the anode; Cu(s) ->Cu2+ (aq) + 2e (impure copper erodes/dissolves)\n(c)Electroplating\nThe label EPNS (Electro Plated Nickel Silver) on some steel/metallic utensils mean they are plated/coated with silver and/or Nickel to improve their appearance (add their aesthetic value) and prevent/slow corrosion(rusting of iron). Electroplating is the process of coating a metal with another metal using an electric current. During electroplating, the cathode is made of the metal to be coated/impure. Example:\nDuring the electroplating of a spoon with silver\n(i) The spoon/impure is placed as the cathode (negative terminal of battery)\n(ii) The pure silver is placed as the anode (positive terminal of battery)\n(iii) The pure silver erodes/ionizes/dissociates to release electrons:\nAg(s) ->Ag+ (aq) + e (impure silver erodes/dissolves)\n(iv) silver (Ag+)ions from electrolyte gain electrons to form pure silver deposits / coat /cover the spoon/impure\nAg+ (aq) + e ->Ag(s) (pure silver deposits /coat/cover on spoon)\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND STRUCTURE\nCHEMICAL BONDING\nA chemical bond is formed when atoms of the same or different elements share, gain, donate or delocalize their outer energy level electrons to combine during chemical reactions in order to be stable. Atoms have equal number of negatively charged electrons in the energy levels and positively charged protons in the nucleus. Atoms are chemically stable if they have filled outer energy level."

Atoms have equal number of negatively charged electrons in the energy levels and positively charged protons in the nucleus. Atoms are chemically stable if they have filled outer energy level. An energy level is full if it has duplet (2) or octet (8) state in outer energy level. Noble gases have duplet /octet. All other atoms try to be like noble gases through chemical reactions and forming molecules. Only electrons in the outer energy level take part in formation of a chemical bond. There are three main types of chemical bonds formed by atoms:\n(i) Covalent bond\n(ii) ionic/electrovalent bond\n(iii) Metallic bond\n(i)COVALENT BOND\nA covalent bond is formed when atoms of the same or different element share some or all the outer energy level electrons to combine during chemical reactions in order to attain duplet or octet. A shared pair of electrons is attracted by the nucleus (protons) of the two atoms sharing. Covalent bonds are mainly formed by non-metals to form molecules. A molecule is a group of atoms of the same or different elements held together by a covalent bond. The number of atoms making a molecule is called atomicity. Noble gases are monatomic because they are stable and thus do not bond with each other or other atoms. Most other gases are diatomic\nThe more the number of electrons shared, the stronger the covalent bond."
"The number of atoms making a molecule is called atomicity. Noble gases are monatomic because they are stable and thus do not bond with each other or other atoms. Most other gases are diatomic\nThe more the number of electrons shared, the stronger the covalent bond. A pair of electrons that do not take part in the formation of a covalent bond is called a lone pair of electrons. Mathematically, the number of electrons to be shared by an atom is equal to the number of electrons remaining for the atom to be stable/attain duplet/octet /have maximum electrons in outer energy level. The following diagrams illustrate the formation of covalent bonds:\na) Hydrogen molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms in the outer energy level each requiring one electron to have a stable duplet.

During ionic/electrovalent bonding there is complete transfer of valence electrons to one electronegative atom from an electropositive atom. All metals are electropositive and easily/readily donate/lose their valence electrons. All non-metals are electronegative and easily/readily gain/acquire extra electrons. Ionic/electrovalent bonding therefore mainly involves transfer of electrons from metal/metallic radical to non-metallic radical. When an electropositive atom donates /loses the valence electrons, it forms a positively charged cation to attain stable octet/duplet. When an electronegative atom gains /acquires extra valence electrons, it forms a negatively charged anion to attain stable octet/duplet. The electrostatic attraction force between the stable positively charged cation and the stable negatively charged anion with opposite charges constitute the ionic bond. Like in covalent/dative/coordinate bonding, only the outer energy level electrons take part in the formation of ionic/electrovalent bond\nLike in covalent/dative/coordinate bonding, the more electrons taking part / involved in the formation of ionic/electrovalent bond, the stronger the ionic /electrovalent bond."

Examples of simple molecular substances include:\n-all gases eg Hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon (IV) oxide,\n-Petroleum fractions eg Petrol, paraffin, diesel, wax,\n-Solid non-metals eg Sulphur, Iodine\n-Water\nb) Low melting/boiling points\nMelting is the process of weakening the intermolecular/ van-der-waal forces/ of attraction between the molecules that holding the substance/compound. Note;\n(i)Melting and boiling does not involve weakening/breaking the strong intramolecular force/covalent bonds holding the atoms in the molecule. (ii) Melting and boiling points increase with increase in atomic radius/size of the atoms making the molecule as the intermolecular forces / van-der-waal forces of attraction between the molecules increase. e.g. Iodine has a higher melting/boiling point than chlorine because it has a higher /bigger atomic radius/size than chlorine, making the molecule to have stronger intermolecular force/ van-der-waal forces of attraction between the molecules than chlorine. Iodine is hence a solid and chlorine is a gas."

Iodine is hence a solid and chlorine is a gas. (c)Insoluble in water/soluble in organic solvents\nPolar substances dissolve in polar solvents. Water is a polar solvent .Molecular substances do not thus dissolve in water because they are non-polar. They dissolve in non-polar solvents like methylbenzene, benzene, tetrachloromethane or propanone. d) Poor conductors of heat and electricity\nSubstances with free mobile ions or free mobile/delocalized electrons conduct electricity. Molecular substances are poor conductors of heat/electricity because their molecules have no free mobile ions/electrons. This makes them very good insulators. Hydrogen bonds\nA hydrogen bond is an intermolecular force of attraction in which a very electronegative atom attracts hydrogen atom of another molecule. The most electronegative elements are Fluorine, Oxygen and Nitrogen .Molecular compounds made up of these elements usually have hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are stronger than van-der-waals forces but weaker than covalent bonds. Molecular compounds with hydrogen bonds thus have higher melting/boiling points than those with van-der-waals forces. Illustration of Hydrogen bonding\na)Water molecule\nDuring formation of covalent bond, the oxygen atom attract/pull the shared electrons more to itself than Hydrogen creating partial negative charges(δ-)in Oxygen and partial positive charges(δ+)in Hydrogen. Two molecules attract each other at the partial charges through Hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding in water makes it;\n(i)a liquid with higher boiling and melting point than simple molecular substances with higher molecular mass. e.g. Hydrogen sulphide as in the table below;\nInfluence of H-bond in water (H2O) in comparison to H2S\n(ii)have higher volume in solid (ice) than liquid (water) and thus ice is less dense than water. Ice therefore floats above liquid water. b)Ethanol molecule\nLike in water, the oxygen atom attracts/pulls the shared electrons in the covalent bond more to itself than Hydrogen."

Ice therefore floats above liquid water. b)Ethanol molecule\nLike in water, the oxygen atom attracts/pulls the shared electrons in the covalent bond more to itself than Hydrogen. This creates a partial negative charge (δ-) on oxygen and partial positive charge(δ+) on hydrogen. Two ethanol molecules attract each other at the partial charges through Hydrogen bonding forming a dimmer. A dimmer is a molecule formed when two molecules join together as below:\nHydrogen bondscovalent bonds\nR1 O δ-…………………….…H δ+ O δ-\nH δ+ R2\nR1 and R2 are extensions of the molecule. For ethanol it is made up of CH3CH2 – to make the structure:\nHydrogen bondscovalent bonds\nCH3CH2 O δ-………………………….…H δ+ O δ-\nH δ+ CH2CH3\nb)Ethanoic acid molecule\nLike in water and ethanol above, the oxygen atom attracts/pulls the shared electrons in the covalent bond in ethanoic acid more to itself than Hydrogen. This creates a partial negative charge (δ-)on oxygen and partial positive charge(δ+) on hydrogen. Two ethanoic acid molecules attract each other at the partial charges through Hydrogen-bonding forming a dimer.

(ii) Giant structure\nThis is the pattern formed after substances /atoms /ions bond to form a long chain network. Giant structures therefore extend in all directions to form a pattern that continues repeating itself. There are three main giant structures. a) giant covalent/atomic structureb)giant ionic structure\nc)giant metallic structure\na) giant covalent/atomic structure\nGiant covalent/atomic structure is the pattern formed after atoms have covalently bonded to form long chain pattern consisting of indefinite number of atoms covalently bonded together. The strong covalent bonds hold all the atoms together to form a very well packed structure. Examples of substances with giant covalent/atomic structure include:\n(i) carbon-diamond\n(ii) carbon-graphite\n(iii)silicon\n(iv) silicon(IV) oxide/sand\nCarbon-graphite and carbon-diamond are allotropes of carbon. Allotropy is the existence of an element in more than one stable physical form at the same temperature and pressure. Allotropes are atoms of the same element existing in more than one stable physical form at the same temperature and pressure. Other elements that exhibit/show allotropy include;\n-Sulphur as monoclinic sulphur and rhombic sulphur\n-Phosphorus as white phosphorus and red phosphorus\nThe structure of carbon-diamond\nCarbon has four valence electrons. The four valence electrons are used to form covalent bonds. During the formation of diamond, one carbon atom covalently bond with four other carbon atoms. C C\nx x. x C x -----> C .x C x. C ------>C C C\nx x."
"C C\nx x. x C x -----> C .x C x. C ------>C C C\nx x. C C\nAfter the bonding, the atoms rearrange to form a regular tetrahedral in which one carbon is in the centre while four are at the apex/corners. C\nC\nC C\nC\nThis pattern repeats itself to form a long chain number of atoms covalently bonded together indefinitely. The pattern is therefore called giant tetrahedral structure. It extends in all directions where one atom of carbon is always a centre of four others at the apex/corner of a regular tetrahedral. C\nC\nCC\nC C\nC\nC\nThe giant tetrahedral structure of carbon-diamond is very well/closely packed and joined/bonded together by strong covalent bond. This makes carbon-diamond to have the following properties:\na) High melting/boiling point. The giant tetrahedral structure is very well packed and joined together by strong covalent bonds. This requires a lot of energy/heat to weaken for the element to melt and break for the element to boil. b) High density. Carbon diamond is the hardest known natural substance. This is because the giant tetrahedral structure is a very well packed pattern/structure and joined together by strong covalent bonds. This makes Carbon diamond be used to make drill for drilling boreholes/oil wells. The giant tetrahedral structure of carbon diamond is a very closely packed pattern /structure such that heat transfer by conduction is possible. This makes carbon diamond a good thermal conductor. c) Poor conductor of electricity. Carbon-diamond has no free/delocalized electrons within its structure and thus do not conduct electricity. d) Insoluble in water. Carbon-diamond is insoluble in water because it is non-polar and do not bond with water molecules. e) Is abrasive/Rough. The edges of the closely well packed pattern/structure of Carbon-diamond make its surface rough/abrasive and thus able to smoothen /cut metals and glass. f) Have characteristic luster. Carbon-diamond has a high optical dispersion and thus able to disperse light to different colours .This makes Carbon-diamond one of the most popular gemstone for making jewellery. The structure of carbon-graphite\nDuring the formation of graphite, one carbon atom covalently bond with three other carbon atoms leaving one free/delocalized electron. CC\nx x."

CC\nx x. x C x -----> C .x C x ------> C C x free/delocalized electron\nx x. CC\nAfter the bonding, the atoms rearrange and join together to form a regular hexagon in which six carbon atoms are at the apex/corners. The regular hexagon is joined to another in layers on the same surface by van-der-waals forces. Each layer extends to form a plane in all directions. The fourth valence electron that does not form covalent bonding is free/mobile /delocalized within the layers. This structure/pattern is called giant hexagonal planar structure. The giant hexagonal planar structure of carbon-graphite is closely packed and joined/bonded together by strong covalent bonds. This makes carbon-graphite to have the following properties:\na) High melting/boiling point. The giant hexagonal planar structure of carbon-graphite is well packed and joined together by strong covalent bonds. This requires a lot of energy/heat to weaken for the element to melt and break for the element to boil. b) Good conductor of electricity. Carbon-graphite has free/delocalized 4th valence electrons within its structure and thus conducts electricity. c) Insoluble in water. Carbon-graphite is insoluble in water because it is non-polar and do not bond with water molecules. d) Soft. Layers of giant hexagonal planar structure of carbon graphite are held together by van-der-waals forces. The van-der-waals forces easily break when pressed and reform back on releasing/reducing pressure/force thus making graphite soft. e) Smooth and slippery. When pressed at an angle the van-der-waals forces easily break and slide over each other making graphite soft and slippery. It is thus used as a dry lubricant instead of oil. f)Some uses of carbon-graphite. 1. As a dry lubricant- carbon graphite is smooth and slippery and thus better lubricant than oil.Oil heat up when reducing friction. 2."
"1. As a dry lubricant- carbon graphite is smooth and slippery and thus better lubricant than oil.Oil heat up when reducing friction. 2. Making Lead-pencils- When pressed at an angle on paper the van-der-waals forces easily break and slide smoothly over contrasting background producing its characteristic black background. 3. As moderator in nuclear reactors to reduce the rate of decay/disintegration of radioactive nuclides/atoms/isotopes. 4. As electrode in dry/wet cells/battery- carbon graphite is inert and good conductor of electricity. Current is thus able to move from one electrode/terminal to the other in dry and wet cells/batteries. Carbon graphite is also very cheap. b) giant ionic structure\nGiant ionic structure is the pattern formed after ions have bonded through ionic/electrovalent bonding to form a long chain consisting of indefinite number of ions. The strong ionic/electrovalent bond holds all the cations and anions together to form a very well packed structure. Substances with giant ionic structure are mainly crystals of salts e.g. sodium chloride, Magnesium chloride, Sodium iodide, Potassium chloride, copper (II) sulphate(VI). The structure of sodium chloride\nSodium chloride is made up of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-)ions. Sodium (Na+) ion is formed when a sodium atom donate /loose/donate an electron. Chloride (Cl-) ion is formed when a chlorine atom gain /acquire an extra electron from sodium atom. Many Na+ and Cl- ions then rearrange such that one Na+ ion is surrounded by six Cl- ions and one Cl- ion is surrounded by six Na+ ions. The pattern formed is a giant cubic structure where Cl- ion is sand witched between Na+ ions and the same to Na+ ions. This pattern forms a crystal. A crystal is a solid form of a substance in which particles are arranged in a definite pattern regularly repeated in three dimensions. The structure of sodium chloride\nThe giant cubic structure/crystal of sodium chloride is as below;\nThe giant cubic structure/crystal of sodium chloride is very well packed and joined by strong ionic/electrovalent bonds. This makes sodium chloride and many ionic compounds to have the following properties:\na) Have high melting /boiling points."
"A crystal is a solid form of a substance in which particles are arranged in a definite pattern regularly repeated in three dimensions. The structure of sodium chloride\nThe giant cubic structure/crystal of sodium chloride is as below;\nThe giant cubic structure/crystal of sodium chloride is very well packed and joined by strong ionic/electrovalent bonds. This makes sodium chloride and many ionic compounds to have the following properties:\na) Have high melting /boiling points. The giant cubic lattice structure of sodium chloride is very closely packed into a crystal that requires a lot of energy/heat to weaken and melt/boil. This applies to all crystalline ionic compounds. b) Are good conductors of electricity in molten and aqueous state but poor conductor of electricity in solid. Ionic compounds have fused ions in solid crystalline state. On heating and dissolving in water, the crystal is broken into free mobile ions (Na+ and Cl- ions). The free mobile ions are responsible for conducting electricity in ionic compounds in molten and aqueous states. c)Soluble in water\nIonic compounds are polar and dissolve in polar water molecules. On dissolving, the crystal breaks to free the fused ions which are then surrounded by water molecules. b) giant metallic structure\nThis is the pattern formed after metallic atoms have bonded through metallic bond. The pattern formed is one where the metallic cations rearrange to form a cubic structure. The cubic structure is bound together by the free delocalized electrons that move freely within. The more delocalized electrons, the stronger the metallic bond. The structure of sodium and aluminium. Sodium has one valence electrons. Aluminium has three valence electrons. After delocalizing the valence electrons ,the metal cations (Na+ and Al3+) rearrange to the apex /corners of a regular cube that extend in all directions. The delocalized electrons remain free and mobile as shown below:\nThe giant cubic structure makes metals to have the following properties:\na) Have high melting/boiling point\nThe giant cubic structure is very well packed and joined/bonded together by the free delocalized electrons. The more delocalized electrons the higher the melting/boiling point. The larger/bigger the metallic cation, the weaker the packing of the cations and thus the lower the melting/boiling point. e.g. (i) Sodium and potassium have both one valence delocalized electron."
"The larger/bigger the metallic cation, the weaker the packing of the cations and thus the lower the melting/boiling point. e.g. (i) Sodium and potassium have both one valence delocalized electron. Atomic radius of potassium is larger/bigger than that of sodium and hence less well packed in its metallic structure. Sodium has therefore a higher melting/boiling point than potassium. (ii) Sodium has one delocalized electron. Aluminium has three delocalized electrons. Atomic radius of sodium is larger/bigger than that of aluminium and hence less well packed in its metallic structure. Aluminium has therefore a higher melting/boiling point than sodium because of the smaller well packed metallic (Al3+) ions and bonded/joined by more/three delocalized electrons. The table below shows the comparative melting/boiling points of some metals:\nb) Good electrical and thermal conductor/electricity. All metals are good conductors of heat and electricity including Mercury which is a liquid. The mobile delocalized electrons are free within the giant metallic structure to move from one end to the other transmitting heat/electric current. The more delocalized electrons the better the thermal/electrical conductivity. High temperatures/heating lowers the thermal/electrical conductivity of metals because the delocalized electrons vibrate and move randomly hindering transfer of heat\nFrom the table above:\nCompare the electrical conductivity of:\n(i)Magnesium and sodium\nMagnesium is a better conductor than sodium. Magnesium has more/two delocalized electrons than sodium. The more delocalized electrons the better the electrical conductor. (ii)Potassium and sodium\nPotassium is a better conductor than sodium. Potassium has bigger/larger atomic radius than sodium. The delocalized electrons are less attracted to the nucleus of the atom and thus more free /mobile and thus better the electrical conductor. c) Insoluble in water\nAll metals are insoluble in water because they are non polar and thus do not bond with water."
"Potassium has bigger/larger atomic radius than sodium. The delocalized electrons are less attracted to the nucleus of the atom and thus more free /mobile and thus better the electrical conductor. c) Insoluble in water\nAll metals are insoluble in water because they are non polar and thus do not bond with water. Metals higher in the reactivity/electrochemical series like; Potassium, sodium, Lithium and Calcium reacts with cold water producing hydrogen gas and forming an alkaline solution of their hydroxides.ie\n2K(s)+2H2O(l)->2KOH(aq)+H2(g)\n2Na(s)+2H2O(l)->2NaOH(aq)+H2(g)\n2Li(s)+2H2O(l)->2LiOH(aq)+H2(g)\nCa(s)+2H2O(l)->Ca(OH)2(aq)+H2(g)\nHeavy metal like Magnesium, Aluminium, Iron, Zinc and Lead react with steam/water vapour to produce hydrogen gas and form the corresponding oxide. Mg(s)+H2O(g)->MgO(s)+H2(g)\nFe(s)+H2O(g)->FeO(s)+H2(g)\nZn(s)+H2O(g)->ZnO(s)+H2(g)\nPb(s)+H2O(g)->PbO(s)+H2(g)\n2Al(s)+3H2O(g)->Al2O3(s)+3H2(g)\nMetals lower in the reactivity/electrochemical series than hydrogen like; copper, Mercury, Gold Silver and Platinum do not react with water/vapour. d) Shiny metallic-lustre\nAll metals have a shiny grey metallic luster except copper which is brown. When exposed to sunlight, the delocalized electrons gain energy, they vibrate on the metal surface scattering light to appear shiny. With time, most metals corrode and are covered by a layer of the metal oxide. The delocalized electrons are unable to gain and scatter light and the metal surface tarnishes/become dull. e) Ductile and malleable\nAll metals are malleable (can be made into thin sheet) and ductile (can be made into wire. When beaten/hit/pressed lengthwise the metallic cations extend and is bound /bonded by the free/mobile electrons to form a sheet."

When beaten/hit/pressed lengthwise and bredthwise the metallic cations extend and is bound /bonded by the free/mobile electrons to form a wire/thin strip. f) Have high tensile strength\nMetals are not brittle. The free delocalized electrons bind the metal together when it is bent /coiled at any angle. The metal thus withstand stress/coiling\ng) Form alloys\nAn alloy is a uniform mixture of two or more metals. Some metals have spaces between their metallic cations which can be occupied by another metal cation with smaller atomic radius. Common alloys include:\nBrass(Zinc and Copper alloy)\nBronze(Copper and Tin alloy)\nGerman silver\nSummary of Bonding and structure\nC. PERIODICITY OF BONDING AND STRUCTURE\nThe periodic table does not classify elements as metals and non-metals. The table arranges them in terms of atomic numbers. However, based on structure and bonding of the elements in the periodic table;\n(i)-the top right hand corner of about twenty elements is non-metals\n(ii)-left of each non-metal is an element which shows characteristics of both metal and non-metal. These elements are called semi-metals/metalloids. They include Boron, silicon, Germanium, Arsenic, and Terullium\n(iii)-all other elements in the periodic table are metal. (iv)-Hydrogen is a non-metal with metallic characteristic/property of donating/losing outer electron to form cation/H+ ion. (v) –bromine is the only known natural liquid non-metal element at room temperature and pressure. (vi) –mercury is only known natural liquid metal element at room temperature and pressure. (vii) Carbon-graphite is a semi metals/metalloids."
"(v) –bromine is the only known natural liquid non-metal element at room temperature and pressure. (vi) –mercury is only known natural liquid metal element at room temperature and pressure. (vii) Carbon-graphite is a semi metals/metalloids. Carbon-diamond is a pure non-metal yet both are allotropes of carbon (same element)\na) Sketch of the periodic table showing metals ,metalloid and non-metals\nMetalsMetalloids Non-metals\nb)Periodicity in the physical properties of elements across period 2 and 3\nStudy table I and II below:\nTable I(period 2)\nTable II (period 3)\nFrom table I and II above:\n1. Explain the trend in atomic radius along /across a period in the periodic table\nObservation\nAtomic radius of elements in the same period decrease successively across/along a period from left to right. Explanation\nAcross/along the period from left to right there is an increase in nuclear charge from additional number of protons and still additional number of electrons entering the same energy level. Increase in nuclear charge increases the effective nuclear attraction on the outer energy level pulling it closer to the nucleus successively across the period .e.g. (i)From the table 1and 2 above, atomic radius of Sodium (0.157nM) is higher than that of Magnesium(0.137nM). This is because Magnesium has more effective nuclear attraction on the outer energy level than Sodium hence pulls outer energy level more nearer to its nucleus than sodium. (ii)The rate of decrease in the atomic radius become smaller as the atom become heavier e.g. Atomic radius of Magnesium from sodium falls by(0.157nM- 0.137nM) =0.02\nAtomic radius of Chlorine from sulphur falls by(0.104nM- 0.099nM) =0.005\nThis is because gaining/adding one more proton to 11 already present cause greater proportional change in nuclear attraction power to magnesium than gaining/adding one more proton to 16 already present in sulphur to chlorine. (iii)Period 3 elements have more energy levels than Period 2 elements. They have therefore bigger/larger atomic radius/size than corresponding period 2 elements in the same group. 2."
"(iii)Period 3 elements have more energy levels than Period 2 elements. They have therefore bigger/larger atomic radius/size than corresponding period 2 elements in the same group. 2. Explain the trend in ionic radius along/across a period in the periodic table\nObservation\nIonic radius of elements in the same period decrease successively across/along a period from left to right for the first three elements then increase drastically then slowly successively decrease. Explanation\nAcross/along the period from left to right elements change form electron donors/losers (reducing agents) to electron acceptors (oxidizing agents). (i)An atom form stable ion by either gaining/acquiring/ accepting extra electron or donating/losing outer electrons. (ii)Metals form stable ions by donating/losing all the outer energy level electrons and thus also the outer energy level .i.e. -Sodium ion has one less energy level than sodium atom. The ion is formed by sodium atom donating/losing (all) the outer energy level electron and thus also the outer energy level making the ion to have smaller ionic radius than atom. (iii)Ionic radius therefore decrease across/along the period from Lithium to Boron in period 2 and from Sodium to Aluminium in period 3.This is because the number of electrons donated/lost causes increased effective nuclear attraction on remaining electrons /energy levels. (iv) Non-metals form stable ion by gaining/acquiring/accepting extra electron in the outer energy level. The extra electron/s increases the repulsion among electrons and reduces the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level. The outer energy level therefore expand/enlarge/increase in order to accommodate the extra repelled electrons .The more electrons gained/accepted/acquired the more repulsion and the more expansion to accommodate them and hence bigger/larger atomic radius. e.g. -Nitrogen ion has three electrons more than Nitrogen atom. The outer energy level expand/enlarge/increase to accommodate the extra repelled electrons. Nitrogen atom thus has smaller atomic radius than the ionic radius of nitrogen ion. (v) Ionic radius decrease from group IV onwards from left to right. This because the number of electrons gained to form ion decrease across/along the period from left to right. e.g. Nitrogen ion has bigger/larger ionic radius than Oxygen. 3. Explain the trend in melting and boiling point of elements in a period in the periodic table."
"Nitrogen ion has bigger/larger ionic radius than Oxygen. 3. Explain the trend in melting and boiling point of elements in a period in the periodic table. Observation\nThe melting and boiling point of elements rise up to the elements in Group IV(Carbon/Silicon) along/across the period then continuously falls. Explanation\nMelting/boiling points depend on the packing of the structure making the element and the strength of the bond holding the atoms/molecules together. Across/along the period (2 and 3) the structure changes from giant metallic, giant atomic/covalent to simple molecular. (i)For metals, the number of delocalized electrons increases across/along the period and hence stronger metallic bond/structure thus requiring a lot of heat/energy to weaken. The strength of a metallic bond also depends on the atomic radius/size. The melting /boiling point decrease as the atomic radius/size of metals increase due to decreased packing of larger atoms. e.g. -The melting /boiling point of Lithium is lower than that of Beryllium because Beryllium has two/more delocalized electrons and hence stronger metallic structure/bond. - The melting /boiling point of Lithium is higher than that of Sodium because the atomic radius/size Lithium is smaller and hence better packed and hence forms stronger metallic structure/bond. (ii)Carbon-graphite/carbon-diamond in period 2 and Silicon in period 3 form very well packed giant atomic/covalent structures held together by strong covalent bonds. These elements have therefore very high melting/boiling points. Both Carbon-graphite/ carbon-diamond have smaller atomic radius/size than Silicon in period 3 and thus higher melting/boiling points due to better/closer packing of smaller atoms in their well packed giant atomic/covalent structures. (ii) Non-metals from group V along/across the period form simple molecules joined by weak intermolecular /van-der-waals force. The weak intermolecular /van-der-waals force require little energy/heat to weaken leading to low melting/boiling points. The strength of the intermolecular /van-der-waals forces decrease with decrease in atomic radius/ size lowering the melting/boiling points along/across the period (and raising the melting/boiling points down the group).e.g. -The melting /boiling point of Nitrogen is higher than that of Oxygen."
"The weak intermolecular /van-der-waals force require little energy/heat to weaken leading to low melting/boiling points. The strength of the intermolecular /van-der-waals forces decrease with decrease in atomic radius/ size lowering the melting/boiling points along/across the period (and raising the melting/boiling points down the group).e.g. -The melting /boiling point of Nitrogen is higher than that of Oxygen. This is because the atomic radius/ size of Nitrogen is higher than that of Oxygen and hence stronger intermolecular /van-der-waals forces between Nitrogen molecules. -The melting /boiling point of Chlorine is higher than that of Fluorine. This is because the atomic radius/ size of Chlorine is higher than that of Fluorine and hence stronger intermolecular /van-der-waals forces between Chlorine molecules. (iii) Rhombic sulphur exists as a puckered ring of S8atoms which are well packed. Before melting the ring break and join to very long chains that entangle each other causing the unusually high melting/boiling point of Rhombic sulphur. (iv) Both sulphur and phosphorus exists as allotropes. Sulphur exists as Rhombic-sulphur and monoclinic-sulphur. Rhombic-sulphur is the stable form of sulphur at room temperature and pressure. Phosphorus exists as white-phosphorus and red-phosphorus. White-phosphorus is the stable form of Phosphorus at room temperature and pressure. 4. State and explain the trend in density of elements in a period in the periodic table. Observation: Density increase upto the elements in group IV then falls across/along the period successively\nExplanation:\nDensity is the mass per unit volume occupied by matter/particles/atoms/molecules of element. (i)For metals ,the stronger metallic bond and the more delocalized electrons ensure a very well packed giant metallic structure that occupy less volume and thus higher density.The more the number of delocalized electrons along/across the period, the higher the density. e.g. (i)Aluminium has a higher density than sodium. This is because aluminium has more /three delocalized electrons than /one sodium thus forms a very well packed giant metallic structure that occupy less volume per given mass/density."
"e.g. (i)Aluminium has a higher density than sodium. This is because aluminium has more /three delocalized electrons than /one sodium thus forms a very well packed giant metallic structure that occupy less volume per given mass/density. (ii)Carbon-graphite ,carbon-diamond and silicon in group IV form a well packed giant atomic/covalent structure that is continuously joined by strong covalent bonds hence occupy less volume per given mass/density. Carbon-graphite form a less well packed giant hexagonal planar structure joined by Van-der-waals forces. Its density (2.25gcm-3) is therefore less than that of Carbon-diamond(3.53gcm-3) and silicon(2.33gcm-3).Both diamond and silicon have giant tetrahedral structure that is better packed. Carbon-diamond has smaller atomic radius/size than silicon. Its density is thus higher because of better packing and subsequently higher density. Carbon-diamond is the hardest known natural substance by having the highest density. (iii) For non-metals, the strength of the intermolecular /van-der-waals forces decreases with decrease in atomic radius/size along/across the period. This decreases the mass occupied by given volume of atoms in a molecule from group VI onwards. e.g. Phosphorus has a higher atomic radius/size than chlorine and Argon and thus stronger intermolecular/van-der-waals forces that ensure a given mass of phosphorus occupy less volume than chlorine and neon. 5. State and explain the trend in thermal/electrical conductivity of elements in a period in the periodic table. Observation:\nIncrease along/across the period from group I, II, and III then decrease in Group IV to drastically decrease in group V to VIII (O). Explanation\n(i)Metals have free delocalized electrons that are responsible for thermal/electrical conductivity.Thermal/electrical conductivity increase with increase in number of delocalized electrons. The thermal conductivity decrease with increase in temperature/heating. e.g. Aluminium with three delocalized electrons from each atom in its metallic structure has the highest electrical /thermal conductivity in period 3. (ii)Carbon-graphite has also free 4th valency electrons that are delocalized within its layers of giant hexagonal planar structure. They are responsible for the electrical conductivity of graphite. (iii)Silicon and carbon diamond do not conduct electricity but conducts heat."
"(ii)Carbon-graphite has also free 4th valency electrons that are delocalized within its layers of giant hexagonal planar structure. They are responsible for the electrical conductivity of graphite. (iii)Silicon and carbon diamond do not conduct electricity but conducts heat. With each atom too close to each other in their very well packed giant tetrahedral structure, heat transfer /radiate between the atoms. The thermal conductivity increase with increase in temperature/heating. (iv) All other non-metals are poor /non-conductor of heat and electricity. They are made of molecules with no free /mobile delocalized electrons in their structure. Periodicity of the oxides of elements along/across period 3\nThe table below summarizes some properties of the oxides of elements in period 3 of the periodic table. 1. All the oxides of elements in period 3 except those of sulphur and chlorine are solids at room temperature and pressure. 2. Across/along the period, bonding of the oxides changes from ionic in sodium oxide magnesium oxide and aluminium oxide (show both ionic and covalent properties) to covalent in the rest of the oxides. 3. Across/along the period, the structure of the oxides changes from giant ionic structure in sodium oxide, magnesium oxide and aluminium oxide to giant atomic/covalent structure in silicon (IV) oxide. The rest of the oxides form simple molecules/molecular structure. 4. Sodium oxide and magnesium oxide are basic /alkaline in nature. Aluminium oxide is amphotellic in nature (shows both acidic and basic characteristics). The rest of the oxides are acidic in nature. 5. Ionic compounds/oxides have very high melting/boiling points because of the strong electrostatic attraction joining the giant ionic crystal lattice. The melting/boiling points increase from sodium oxide to aluminium oxide as the number of electrons involved in bonding increase, increasing the strength of the ionic bond/structure. 6. Silicon (IV) oxide is made of a well packed giant atomic/covalent structure joined by strong covalent bonds. This results in a solid with very high melting/boiling point. 7.Phosphorus (V) oxide, sulphur(IV) oxide/ sulphur (VI) oxide and dichloride heptoxide exist as simple molecules/molecular structure joined by weak van-der-waals/intermolecular forces."
"Silicon (IV) oxide is made of a well packed giant atomic/covalent structure joined by strong covalent bonds. This results in a solid with very high melting/boiling point. 7.Phosphorus (V) oxide, sulphur(IV) oxide/ sulphur (VI) oxide and dichloride heptoxide exist as simple molecules/molecular structure joined by weak van-der-waals/intermolecular forces. This results in them existing as low melting /boiling point solids/gases. 8. Ionic oxide conducts electricity in molten and aqueous states but not in solid. In solid state the ions are fused/fixed but on heating to molten state and when dissolved in water, the ions are free / mobile. Sodium oxide, magnesium oxide and aluminium oxide are therefore good conductors in molten and aqueous states. 9. Covalent bonded oxides do not conduct electricity in solid, molten or in aqueous states. This is because they do not have free / mobile ion. Phosphorus (V) oxide, sulphur (IV) oxide/ sulphur (VI) oxide and dichloride heptoxide are thus non-conductors/insulators. 10. Silicon (IV) oxide is a poor/weak conductor of heat in solid state. This is because it has very closely packed structure for heat to radiate conduct along its structure. 11. Electopositivity decrease across the period while electronegativity increase across the period. The oxides thus become less ionic and more covalent along/across the period. 12.The steady change from giant ionic structure to giant atomic/ covalent structure then simple molecular structure lead to profound differences in the reaction of the oxides with water,acids and alkalis/bases:\n(i) Reaction with water\na) Ionic oxides react with water to form alkaline solutions e.g.;\nI.Sodium oxide reacts/dissolves in water forming an alkaline solution of sodium hydroxide.

Across/along the period the structure changes from giant ionic in Sodium Chloride and Magnesium chloride to simple molecules/molecular structure in the rest of the chlorides. 5. Ionic chlorides have very high melting /boiling points because of the strong ionic bond/electrostatic attraction between the ions in their crystal lattice.The rest of the chlorides have low melting /boiling points because of the weak van-der-waal /intermolecular forces. 6. Sodium Chloride and Magnesium chloride in molten and aqueous state have free/mobile ions and thus good electrical conductors. Aluminium chloride is a poor conductor. The rest of the chlorides do not conduct because they have no free/mobile ions. 7. Ionic chloride form neutral solutions with pH =7. These chlorides ionize/dissociate completely into free cations and anions.i.e;\nSodium Chloride and Magnesium chloride have pH=7 because they are fully/completely ionized/dissociated into free ions.

"Scientists have tried to group them together in a periodic table. A periodic table is a horizontal and vertical arrangement of elements according to their atomic numbers. This table was successfully arranged in 1913 by the British scientist Henry Moseley from the previous work of the Russian Scientist Dmitri Mendeleev. The horizontal arrangement forms period. Atoms in the same period have the same the same number of energy levels in their electronic structure. i.e. The number of energy levels in the electronic configuration of an element determine the period to which the element is in the periodic table. e.g. Which period of the periodic table are the following isotopes/elements/atoms? 126C\nElectron structure 2:4 => 2 energy levels used thus Period 2\n2311Na\nElectron structure 2:8:1 => 3 energy levels used thus Period 3\n3919K\nElectron structure 2:8:8:1 => 4 energy levels used thus Period 4\n11H\nElectron structure 1: => 1 energy level used thus Period 1\nThe vertical arrangement of elements forms a group. Atoms in the same have the same the same group have the same number of outer energy level electrons as per their electronic structure. i.e. The number of electrons in the outer energy level an element determine the group to which the element is, in the periodic table. 126C\nElectron structure 2:4 => 4 electrons in outer energy level thus Group IV\n2311C\nElectron structure 2:8:1 => 1 electron in outer energy level thus Group I\n3919K\nElectron structure 2:8:8:1=>1 electron in outer energy level thus Group I\n11H\nElectron structure 1: => 1 electron in outer energy level thus Group I\nBy convention;\n(i)Periods are named using English numerals 1, 2, 3, 4…\n(ii)Groups are named using Roman numerals I, II, III, IV…\nThere are eighteen groups in a standard periodic table. There are seven periods in a standard periodic table. When an atom has maximum number of electrons in its outer energy level, it is said to be stable. When an atom has no maximum number of electrons in its outer energy level, it is said to be unstable. All stable atoms are in group 8/18 of the periodic table. All other elements are unstable."
"When an atom has no maximum number of electrons in its outer energy level, it is said to be unstable. All stable atoms are in group 8/18 of the periodic table. All other elements are unstable. All unstable atoms/isotopes try to be stable through chemical reactions. A chemical reaction involves gaining or losing outer electrons (electron transfer) .When electron transfer take place, an ion is formed. An ion is formed when an unstable atom gain or donate electrons in its outer energy level in order to be stable. Whether an atom gain or donate electrons depend on the relative energy required to donate or gain extra electrons i.e. Examples\n199 F has electronic structure/configuration 2:7. It can donate the seven outer electrons to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:. It can gain one extra electron to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:8. Gaining requires less energy, and thus Fluorine reacts by gaining one extra electrons. 2313 Al has electronic structure/configuration 2:8:3\nIt can donate the three outer electrons to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:8. It can gain five extra electrons to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:8:8. Donating requires less energy, and thus Aluminium reacts by donating its three outer electrons. Elements with less than four electrons in the outer energy level donates /lose the outer electrons to be stable and form a positively charged ion called cation. A cation therefore has more protons (positive charge) than electrons (negative charge)\nGenerally metals usually form cation\nElements with more than four electrons in the outer energy level gain /acquire extra electrons in the outer energy level to be stable and form a negatively charged ion called anion. An anion therefore has fewer protons (positive charge) than electrons (negative charge)\nGenerally non metals usually form anion. Except Hydrogen\nThe charge carried by an ion is equal to the number of electrons gained/acquired or donated/lost. Examples of ion formation\n1.11H\nH-> H+ + e\n(atom)(monovalent cation) (electrons donated/lost)\nElectronic configuration 1:(No electrons remains)\n2. 2713 Al\nAl-> Al3+ + 3e\n(atom) (trivalent cation) (3 electrons donated/lost)\nElectron 2:8:32:8\nstructure (unstable) (stable)\n3."

When an element acquires/gains extra electrons in its outer energy level, the process is called reduction. The charge carried by an atom, cation or anion is its oxidation state.

PERIODICITY OF CHEMICAL FAMILES/DOWN THE GROUP\nThe number of valence electrons and the number of occupied energy levels in an atom of an element determine the position of an element in the periodic table .i.e\nThe number of occupied energy levels determines the Period and the valence electrons determine the Group. Elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties. The trends in physical and chemical properties of elements in the same group vary down the group. Elements in the same group thus constitute a chemical family. Group I elements: Alkali metals\nGroup I elements are called Alkali metals except Hydrogen which is a non metal."
"The trends in physical and chemical properties of elements in the same group vary down the group. Elements in the same group thus constitute a chemical family. Group I elements: Alkali metals\nGroup I elements are called Alkali metals except Hydrogen which is a non metal. The alkali metals include:\nAll alkali metals atom has one electron in the outer energy level. They therefore are monovalent. They donate /lose the outer electron to have oxidation state M+\nThe number of energy levels increases down the group from Lithium to Francium. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size of Potassium is bigger/larger than that of sodium because Potassium has more/4 energy levels than sodium (3 energy levels). Atomic and ionic radius\nThe distance between the centre of the nucleus of an atom and the outermost energy level occupied by electron/s is called atomic radius. Atomic radius is measured in nanometers(n).The higher /bigger the atomic radius the bigger /larger the atomic size. The distance between the centre of the nucleus of an ion and the outermost energy level occupied by electron/s is called ionic radius. Ionic radius is also measured in nanometers (n).The higher /bigger the ionic radius the bigger /larger the size of the ion. Atomic radius and ionic radius depend on the number of energy levels occupied by electrons. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic /ionic radius. e.g. The atomic radius of Francium is bigger/larger than that of sodium because Francium has more/7 energy levels than sodium (3 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkali metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkali metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because alkali metals react by losing/donating the outer electron and hence lose the outer energy level. Table showing the atomic and ionic radius of some alkali metals\nThe atomic radius of sodium is 0.157nM .The ionic radius of Na+ is 0.095nM. This is because sodium reacts by donating/losing the outer electrons and hence the outer energy level. The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. Electropositivity\nThe ease of donating/losing electrons is called electropositivity."
"This is because sodium reacts by donating/losing the outer electrons and hence the outer energy level. The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. Electropositivity\nThe ease of donating/losing electrons is called electropositivity. All alkali metals are electropositive. Electropositivity increase as atomic radius increase. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The outer electrons experience less nuclear attraction and can be lost/ donated easily/with ease. Francium is the most electropositive element in the periodic table because it has the highest/biggest atomic radius. Ionization energy\nThe minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom of element in its gaseous state is called 1st ionization energy. The SI unit of ionization energy is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 .Ionization energy depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer electrons/energy level and thus the lower the ionization energy. For alkali metals the 1st ionization energy decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. e.g. The 1st ionization energy of sodium is 496 kJmole-1 while that of potassium is 419 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from sodium to Potassium. It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electrons in Potassium than in sodium. Physical properties\nSoft/Easy to cut: Alkali metals are soft and easy to cut with a knife. The softness and ease of cutting increase down the group from Lithium to Francium. This is because an increase in atomic radius, decreases the strength of metallic bond and the packing of the metallic structure\nAppearance: Alkali metals have a shiny grey metallic luster when freshly cut. The surface rapidly/quickly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface rapidly/quickly reacts with elements of air/oxygen. Melting and boiling points: Alkali metals have a relatively low melting/boiling point than common metals like Iron. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weak metallic bond/structure."

Melting and boiling points: Alkali metals have a relatively low melting/boiling point than common metals like Iron. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weak metallic bond/structure. Electrical/thermal conductivity: Alkali metals are good thermal and electrical conductors. Metals conduct using the outer mobile delocalized electrons. The delocalized electrons move randomly within the metallic structure. Summary of some physical properties of the 1st three alkali metals\nChemical properties\n(i)Reaction with air/oxygen\nOn exposure to air, alkali metals react with the elements in the air. Example\nOn exposure to air, Sodium first reacts with Oxygen to form sodium oxide. 4Na(s)+O2(g) ->2Na2O(s)\nThe sodium oxide formed further reacts with water/moisture in the air to form sodium hydroxide solution. Na2O(s) +H2O(l) -> 2NaOH(aq)\nSodium hydroxide solution reacts with carbon (IV) oxide in the air to form sodium carbonate. 2NaOH (aq) + CO2 (g) -> Na2CO3 (g) + H2O (l)\n(ii)Burning in air/oxygen\nLithium burns in air with a crimson/deep red flame to form Lithium oxide\n4Li (s)+O2 (g) ->2Li2O(s)\nSodium burns in air with a yellow flame to form sodium oxide\n4Na (s)+O2 (g) ->2Na2O(s)\nSodium burns in oxygen with a yellow flame to form sodium peroxide\n2Na (s)+O2 (g) ->Na2O2 (s)\nPotassium burns in air with a lilac/purple flame to form potassium oxide\n4K (s)+O2 (g) ->2K2O (s)\n(iii) Reaction with water:\nExperiment\nMeasure 500 cm3 of water into a beaker. Put three drops of phenolphthalein indicator. Put about 0.5g of Lithium metal into the beaker. Determine the pH of final product\nRepeat the experiment using about 0.1 g of Sodium and Potassium. Caution: Keep a distance\nObservations\nExplanation\nAlkali metals are less dense than water."
"Put about 0.5g of Lithium metal into the beaker. Determine the pH of final product\nRepeat the experiment using about 0.1 g of Sodium and Potassium. Caution: Keep a distance\nObservations\nExplanation\nAlkali metals are less dense than water. They therefore float in water. They react with water to form a strongly alkaline solution of their hydroxides and producing hydrogen gas. The rate of this reaction increase down the group. i.e. Potassium is more reactive than sodium .Sodium is more reactive than Lithium. The reactivity increases as electropositivity increases of the alkali increases. This is because as the atomic radius increases, the ease of donating/losing outer electron increases during chemical reactions.

Introduce it on a Bunsen flame until it catches fire. Quickly and carefully lower it into a gas jar containing dry chlorine to cover the gas jar. Repeat with about 0.5g of Lithium. Caution: This experiment should be done in fume chamber because chlorine is poisonous /toxic. Observation\nSodium metal continues to burn with a yellow flame forming white solid/fumes. Lithium metal continues to burn with a crimson flame forming white solid / fumes. Alkali metals react with chlorine gas to form the corresponding metal chlorides. The reactivity increase as electropositivity increase down the group from Lithium to Francium. The ease of donating/losing the outer electrons increase as the atomic radius increase and the outer electron is less attracted to the nucleus."

(ii)Sodium chloride is used in seasoning food. (iii)Molten mixture of sodium and potassium is used as coolant in nuclear reactors. (iv)Sodium is used in making sodium hydroxide used in making soapy and soapless detergents. (v)Sodium is used as a reducing agent for the extraction of titanium from Titanium (IV) chloride. (vi)Lithium is used in making special high strength glasses\n(vii)Lithium compounds are used to make dry cells in mobile phones and computer laptops. Group II elements: Alkaline earth metals\nGroup II elements are called Alkaline earth metals . The alkaline earth metals include:\nAll alkaline earth metal atoms have two electrons in the outer energy level. They therefore are divalent. They donate /lose the two outer electrons to have oxidation state M2+\nThe number of energy levels increases down the group from Beryllium to Radium. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Calcium is bigger/larger than that of Magnesium because Calcium has more/4 energy levels than Magnesium (3 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkaline earth metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkaline earth metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because they react by losing/donating the two outer electrons and hence lose the outer energy level."
"Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkaline earth metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkaline earth metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because they react by losing/donating the two outer electrons and hence lose the outer energy level. Table showing the atomic and ionic radius of the 1st three alkaline earth metals\nThe atomic radius of Magnesium is 0.136nM .The ionic radius of Mg2+ is 0.065nM. This is because Magnesium reacts by donating/losing the two outer electrons and hence the outer energy level. The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. Electropositivity\nAll alkaline earth metals are also electropositive like alkali metals. The electropositivity increase with increase in atomic radius/size. Calcium is more electropositive than Magnesium. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The two outer electrons in calcium experience less nuclear attraction and can be lost/ donated easily/with ease because of the higher/bigger atomic radius. Ionization energy\nFor alkaline earth metals the 1st ionization energy decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. e.g. The 1st ionization energy of Magnesium is 900 kJmole-1 while that of Calcium is 590 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from magnesium to calcium. It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electron in calcium than in magnesium. The minimum amount of energy required to remove a second electron from an ion of an element in its gaseous state is called the 2nd ionization energy. The 2nd ionization energy is always higher /bigger than the 1st ionization energy. This is because once an electron is donated /lost form an atom, the overall effective nuclear attraction on the remaining electrons/energy level increase. Removing a second electron from the ion require therefore more energy than the first electron. The atomic radius of alkali metals is higher/bigger than that of alkaline earth metals."
"This is because once an electron is donated /lost form an atom, the overall effective nuclear attraction on the remaining electrons/energy level increase. Removing a second electron from the ion require therefore more energy than the first electron. The atomic radius of alkali metals is higher/bigger than that of alkaline earth metals. This is because across/along the period from left to right there is an increase in nuclear charge from additional number of protons and still additional number of electrons entering the same energy level. Increase in nuclear charge increases the effective nuclear attraction on the outer energy level which pulls it closer to the nucleus. e.g. Atomic radius of Sodium (0.157nM) is higher than that of Magnesium (0.137nM). This is because Magnesium has more effective nuclear attraction on the outer energy level than Sodium hence pulls outer energy level more nearer to its nucleus. Physical properties\nSoft/Easy to cut: Alkaline earth metals are not soft and easy to cut with a knife like alkali metals. This is because of the decrease in atomic radius of corresponding alkaline earth metal, increases the strength of metallic bond and the packing of the metallic structure. Alkaline earth metals are:\nductile(able to form wire/thin long rods)\nmalleable(able to be hammered into sheet/long thin plates)\nhave high tensile strength(able to be coiled without breaking/ not brittle/withstand stress)\nAppearance: Alkali earth metals have a shiny grey metallic luster when their surface is freshly polished /scrubbed. The surface slowly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface slowly undergoes oxidation to form an oxide. This oxide layer should be removed before using the alkaline earth metals. Melting and boiling points: Alkaline earth metals have a relatively high melting/ boiling point than alkali metals. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weaker metallic bond/structure. Alkaline earth metals use two delocalized electrons to form a stronger metallic bond /structure. The melting and boiling points decrease down the group as the atomic radius/size increase reducing the strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure. e.g. Beryllium has a melting point of 1280oC."
"The melting and boiling points decrease down the group as the atomic radius/size increase reducing the strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure. e.g. Beryllium has a melting point of 1280oC. Magnesium has a melting point of 650oC.Beryllium has a smaller atomic radius/size than magnesium .The strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure is thus stronger in beryllium. Electrical/thermal conductivity: Alkaline earth metals are good thermal and electrical conductors. The two delocalized valence electrons move randomly within the metallic structure. Electrical conductivity increase down the group as the atomic radius/size increase making the delocalized outer electrons less attracted to nucleus. Alkaline earth metals are better thermal and electrical conductors than alkali metals because they have more/two outer delocalized electrons. e.g. Magnesium is a better conductor than sodium because it has more/two delocalized electrons than sodium. The more delocalized electrons the better the electrical conductor. Calcium is a better conductor than magnesium. Calcium has bigger/larger atomic radius than magnesium because the delocalized electrons are less attracted to the nucleus of calcium and thus more free /mobile and thus better the electrical conductor\nSummary of some physical properties of the 1st three alkaline earth metals\nChemical properties\nReaction with air/oxygen\nOn exposure to air, the surface of alkaline earth metals is slowly oxidized to its oxide on prolonged exposure to air.

(vi)In the blast furnace-Limestone is added to the blast furnace to produce more reducing agent and remove slag in the blast furnace for extraction of Iron. (c)Group VII elements: Halogens\nGroup VII elements are called Halogens. They are all non metals. They include:\nAll halogen atoms have seven electrons in the outer energy level. They acquire/gain one electron in the outer energy level to be stable. They therefore are therefore monovalent .They exist in oxidation state X-\nThe number of energy levels increases down the group from Fluorine to Astatine. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Chlorine is bigger/larger than that of Fluorine because Chlorine has more/3 energy levels than Fluorine (2 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of Halogens increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of Halogens is smaller than the ionic radius. This is because they react by gaining/acquiring extra one electron in the outer energy level. The effective nuclear attraction on the more/extra electrons decreases. The incoming extra electron is also repelled causing the outer energy level to expand to reduce the repulsion and accommodate more electrons. Table showing the atomic and ionic radius of four Halogens\nThe atomic radius of Chlorine is 0.099nM .The ionic radius of Cl- is 0.181nM. This is because Chlorine atom/molecule reacts by gaining/acquiring extra one electron. The more/extra electrons/energy level experience less effective nuclear attraction /pull towards the nucleus. The outer energy level expand/increase to reduce the repulsion of the existing and incoming gained /acquired electrons. Electronegativity\nThe ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons is called electronegativity. All halogens are electronegative. Electronegativity decreases as atomic radius increase."
"Electronegativity\nThe ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons is called electronegativity. All halogens are electronegative. Electronegativity decreases as atomic radius increase. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The outer electrons experience less nuclear attraction and thus ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons decrease. It is measured using Pauling’s scale. Where Fluorine with Pauling scale 4.0 is the most electronegative element and thus the highest tendency to acquire/gain extra electron. Table showing the electronegativity of the halogens\nThe electronegativity of the halogens decrease down the group from fluorine to Astatine. This is because atomic radius increases down the group and thus decrease electron – attracting power down the group from fluorine to astatine. Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table because it has the small atomic radius. Electron affinity\nThe minimum amount of energy required to gain/acquire an extra electron by an atom of element in its gaseous state is called 1st electron affinity. The SI unit of electron affinity is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1. Electron affinity depends on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons and thus the lower the electron affinity. For halogens the 1st electron affinity decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. Due to its small size/atomic radius Fluorine shows exceptionally low electron affinity. This is because a lot of energy is required to overcome the high repulsion of the existing and incoming electrons. Table showing the election affinity of halogens for the process\nX + e ->X-\nThe higher the electron affinity the more stable theion.i.e\nCl- is a more stable ion than Br- because it has a more negative / exothermic electron affinity than Br-\nElectron affinity is different from:\n(i) Ionization energy. Ionization energy is the energy required to lose/donate an electron in an atom of an element in its gaseous state while electron affinity is the energy required to gain/acquire extra electron by an atom of an element in its gaseous state. (ii) Electronegativity. -Electron affinity is the energy required to gain an electron in an atom of an element in gaseous state."
"Ionization energy is the energy required to lose/donate an electron in an atom of an element in its gaseous state while electron affinity is the energy required to gain/acquire extra electron by an atom of an element in its gaseous state. (ii) Electronegativity. -Electron affinity is the energy required to gain an electron in an atom of an element in gaseous state. It involves the process:\nX(g) + e -> X-(g)\nElectronegativity is the ease/tendency of gaining/ acquiring electrons by an element during chemical reactions. It does not involve use of energy but theoretical arbitrary Pauling’ scale of measurements. Physical properties\nState at room temperature\nFluorine and Chlorine are gases, Bromine is a liquid and Iodine is a solid. Astatine is radioactive. All halogens exist as diatomic molecules bonded by strong covalent bond. Each molecule is joined to the other by weak intermolecular forces/ Van-der-waals forces. Melting/Boiling point\nThe strength of intermolecular/Van-der-waals forces of attraction increase with increase in molecular size/atomic radius. Iodine has therefore the largest atomic radius and thus strongest intermolecular forces to make it a solid. Iodine sublimes when heated to form (caution: highly toxic/poisonous) purple vapour. This is because Iodine molecules are held together by weak van-der-waals/intermolecular forces which require little heat energy to break. Electrical conductivity\nAll Halogens are poor conductors of electricity because they have no free delocalized electrons. Solubility in polar and non-polar solvents\nAll halogens are soluble in water (polar solvent). When a boiling tube containing either chlorine gas or bromine vapour is separately inverted in a beaker containing distilled water and tetrachloromethane (non-polar solvent), the level of solution in boiling tube rises in both water and tetrachloromethane. This is because halogen are soluble in both polar and non-polar solvents. Solubility of halogens in water/polar solvents decrease down the group. Solubility of halogens in non-polar solvent increases down the group. The level of water in chlorine is higher than in bromine and the level of tetrachloromethane in chlorine is lower than in bromine."
"Solubility of halogens in water/polar solvents decrease down the group. Solubility of halogens in non-polar solvent increases down the group. The level of water in chlorine is higher than in bromine and the level of tetrachloromethane in chlorine is lower than in bromine. Caution: Tetrachloromethane , Bromine vapour and Chlorine gas are all highly toxic/poisonous. Table showing the physical properties of Halogens\nChemical properties\n(i)Displacement\nExperiment\nPlace separately in test tubes about 5cm3 of sodium chloride, Sodium bromide and Sodium iodide solutions. Add 5 drops of chlorine water to each test tube:\nRepeat with 5 drops of bromine water instead of chlorine water\nObservation\nUsing Chlorine water\n-Yellow colour of chlorine water fades in all test tubes except with sodium chloride. -Coloured Solution formed. Using Bromine water\n-Yellow colour of bromine water fades in test tubes containing sodium iodide. -Coloured Solution formed. Explanation\nThe halogens displace each other from their solution. The more electronegative displace the less electronegative from their solution. Chlorine is more electronegative than bromine and iodine. On adding chlorine water, bromine and Iodine are displaced from their solutions by chlorine. Bromine is more electronegative than iodide but less 6than chlorine. On adding Bromine water, iodine is displaced from its solution but not chlorine."
"On adding chlorine water, bromine and Iodine are displaced from their solutions by chlorine. Bromine is more electronegative than iodide but less 6than chlorine. On adding Bromine water, iodine is displaced from its solution but not chlorine.

Reduce tooth decay when added in small amounts/quantities in tooth paste. NB –large small quantities of fluorine /fluoride ions in water cause browning of teeth/flourosis. Hydrogen fluoride is used to engrave words /pictures in glass. Bromine - Silver bromide is used to make light sensitive photographic paper/films. Iodide – Iodine dissolved in alcohol is used as medicine to kill bacteria in skin cuts."
"Hydrogen fluoride is used to engrave words /pictures in glass. Bromine - Silver bromide is used to make light sensitive photographic paper/films. Iodide – Iodine dissolved in alcohol is used as medicine to kill bacteria in skin cuts. It is called tincture of iodine. The table below to show some compounds of halogens\nBelow is the table showing the bond energy of four halogens. Bond Bond energy k J mole-1\nCl-Cl242\nBr-Br193\nI-I151\nWhat do you understand by the term “bond energy”\nBond energy is the energy required to break/ form one mole of chemical bond\nExplain the trend in bond Energy of the halogens above:\n-Decrease down the group from chlorine to Iodine\n-Atomic radius increase down the group decreasing the energy required to break the covalent bonds between the larger atom with reduced effective nuclear @ charge an outer energy level that take part in bonding. (c)Group VIII elements: Noble gases\nGroup VIII elements are called Noble gases. They are all non metals. Noble gases occupy about 1.0% of the atmosphere as colourless gaseous mixture. Argon is the most abundant with 0.9%. They exist as monatomic molecules with very weak van-der-waals /intermolecular forces holding the molecules. They include:\nAll noble gas atoms have a stable duplet(two electrons in the 1st energy level) or octet(eight electrons in other outer energy level)in the outer energy level. They therefore do not acquire/gain extra electron in the outer energy level or donate/lose. They therefore are therefore zerovalent . The number of energy levels increases down the group from Helium to Randon. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size/radius. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Argon is bigger/larger than that of Neon because Argon has more/3 energy levels than Neon (2 energy levels). Atomic radius noble gases increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The effective nuclear attraction on the outer electrons thus decrease down the group. The noble gases are generally unreactive because the outer energy level has the stable octet/duplet. The stable octet/duplet in noble gas atoms lead to comparatively very high 1st ionization energy."
"The effective nuclear attraction on the outer electrons thus decrease down the group. The noble gases are generally unreactive because the outer energy level has the stable octet/duplet. The stable octet/duplet in noble gas atoms lead to comparatively very high 1st ionization energy. This is because losing /donating an electron from the stable atom require a lot of energy to lose/donate and make it unstable. As atomic radius increase down the group and the 1st ionization energy decrease, very electronegative elements like Oxygen and Fluorine are able to react and bond with lower members of the noble gases.e.g\nXenon reacts with Fluorine to form a covalent compound XeF6.This is because the outer electrons/energy level if Xenon is far from the nucleus and thus experience less effective nuclear attraction. Noble gases have low melting and boiling points. This is because they exist as monatomic molecules joined by very weak intermolecular/van-der-waals forces that require very little energy to weaken and form liquid and break to form a gas. The intermolecular/van-der-waals forces increase down the group as the atomic radius/size increase from Helium to Radon. The melting and boiling points thus increase also down the group. Noble gases are insoluble in water and are poor conductors of electricity. Uses of noble gases\nArgon is used in light bulbs to provide an inert environment to prevent oxidation of the bulb filament\nArgon is used in arch welding as an insulator. Neon is used in street and advertisement light\nHelium is mixed with Oxygen during deep sea diving and mountaineering. Helium is used in weather balloon for meteorological research instead of Hydrogen because it is unreactive/inert.Hydrogen when impure can ignite with an explosion. Helium is used in making thermometers for measuring very low temperatures. CHEMISTRY OF CARBONA: CARBON\nCarbon is an element in Group IV(Group 4)of the Periodic table .It has atomic number 6 and electronic configuration 2:4 and thus has four valence electrons(tetravalent).It does not easily ionize but forms strong covalent bonds with other elements including itself. (a)Occurrence\nCarbon mainly naturally occurs as:\n(i)allotropes of carbon i.e graphite, diamond and fullerenes."

Pickling of metals to remove oside layers on their surfaces. In the manufacture of dyes and drugs. Making zinc chloride for making dry cells. (iv)Diagram Showing Industrial manufacture. (ii)Environmental effects of manufacturing HCl\nHydrochloric acid is acidic. Any leakage from a manufacturing plant to nearby rivers/lake causes exess acidity that lowers pH of water killing marine life. Hydrogen chloride leakage into atmosphere dissolves to form “acidic rain” that accelerate corrosion in buildings, Breathing problems to human beings and kill fauna and flora around the paint. Chlorine leakage causes breathing and sight problems to human being. It accelerates bleaching of dyed metals. Hydrogen leakage can cause an explosion because impure hydrogen explodes on ignition. Factors considered in setting hydrochloric acid manufacturing plant. Nearness to the manufacturing of sodium hydroxide because the byproducts of electrolysis of brine are the raw materials for hydrochloric acid plant. Availability of natural gas for extraction of hydrogen. Nearness/Availability of water to dissolve the hydrogen chloride gas. Availability of labour, market, capital and good means of transport.

"Chlorides are salts derived from hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is a monobasic (HX) salt with only one ionazable/replaceable “H” in its molecule. All chlorides are therefore normal salts. All metals exist as chloride salt except platinum and gold as below\n(i)Both FeCl2 and FeCl3 exists but FeCl2 is readily oxidized to FeCl3 because it is more stable. (ii)PbCl2 and PbCl4 exist but PbCl4 is only oxidized to form PbCl2 by using excess chlorine. It is less stable. (iii)CuCl and CuCl2 exists but CuCl2 is (thermodynamically) more stable than CuCl. CuCl disproportionate to Cu and CuCl2.. (iv)HgCl and HgCl2exists as molecular compounds. All chlorides are soluble/dissolves in water except silver chloride(AgCl), Copper (I) chloride CuCl, Mercury (I) Chloride Hg2Cl2 and Lead (II) Chloride PbCl2 that dissolves in warm water. Most chlorides are very stable compounds. They do not decompose on gentle or strong bunsen burner heating in a school laboratory except Ammonium Chloride.

Ammonia gas is less dense than hydrogen chloride. It is a basic gas and diffuses out faster to turn red litmus paper to blue. Hydrogen chloride is an acidic gas .It is denser than ammonia gas and thus diffuses slower than ammonia gas to turn the already both blue litmus paper to red.

Proteins, amino acids, polypeptides in living things contain nitrogen. b) Isolation of nitrogen from the air. Nitrogen can be isolated from other gases present in air like oxygen, water (vapour), carbon (IV) oxide and noble gases as in the school laboratory as in the flow chart below:\nWater is added slowly into an “empty flask” which forces the air out into another flask containing concentrated sulphuric (VI) acid. Concentrated sulphuric (VI) acid is hygroscopic. It therefore absorb/remove water present in the air sample. More water forces the air into the flask containing either concentrated sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide solution. These alkalis react with carbon IV) oxide to form the carbonates and thus absorbs/remove carbon IV) oxide present in the air sample.

Ammonia is very soluble in water. When a drop of water is introduced into flask containing ammonia, it dissolves all the ammonia in the flask. If water is subsequently allowed into the flask through a small inlet, atmospheric pressure forces it very fast to occupy the vacuum forming a fountain. If the water contains three/few drops of litmus solution, the litmus solution turns blue because ammonia is an alkaline/basic gas. If the water contains three/few drops of phenolphthalein indicator, the indicator turns pink because ammonia is an alkaline/basic gas.

Hydrogen and Nitrogen are then mixed in the ratio of 3:1 respectively. The mixture is compressed to 200-250atmoshere pressure to liquidify. The liquid mixture is then heated to 400- 450oC.The hot compressed gases are then passed over finely divided Iron catalyst promoted/impregnated with Al2O3 /K2O .Promoters increase the efficiency of the catalyst.

More/higher yield of ammonia is attained. (ii)Increase in pressure shift the equilibrium forward to the right where there is less volume/molecules. More/higher yield of ammonia is attained. Very high pressures raise the cost of production because they are expensive to produce and maintain. An optimum pressure of about 200atmospheres is normally used. (iii)Increase in temperature shift the equilibrium backward to the left because the reaction is exothermic (ΔH = -92kJ) . Ammonia formed decomposes back to Nitrogen and Hydrogen to remove excess heat therefore a less yield of ammonia is attained. Very low temperature decreases the collision frequency of Nitrogen and Hydrogen and thus the rate of reaction too slow and uneconomical. An optimum temperature of about 450oC is normally used.

B. Extraction of Sulphur from Fraschs process\nSuphur occurs about 200 metres underground. The soil structure in these areas is usually weak and can easily cave in. Digging of tunnels is thus discouraged in trying to extract the mineral. Sulphur is extracted by drilling three concentric /round pipes of diameter of ratios 2:8: 18 centimeters. Superheated water at 170oC and 10atmosphere pressure is forced through the outermost pipe. The high pressures ensure the water remains as liquid at high temperatures instead of vapour of vapour /gas. The superheated water melts the sulphur because the melting point of sulphur is lower at about at about 115oC. A compressed air at 15 atmospheres is forced /pumped through the innermost pipe. The hot air forces the molten sulphur up the middle pipe where it is collected and solidifies in a large tank. It is about 99% pure. Diagram showing extraction of Sulphur from Fraschs Process\nC.

"Diagram showing extraction of Sulphur from Fraschs Process\nC. Allotropes of Sulphur. 1. Sulphur exists as two crystalline allotropic forms:\n(i)Rhombic sulphur\n(ii)Monoclinic sulphur\nRhombic sulphur and Monoclinic sulphur have a transition temperature of 96oC.This is the temperature at which one allotrope changes to the other. 2. Sulphur exists in non-crystalline forms as:\n(i)Plastic sulphur-\nPlastic sulphur is prepared from heating powdered sulphur to boil then pouring a thin continuous stream in a beaker with cold water. A long thin elastic yellow thread of plastic sulphur is formed .If left for long it turn to bright yellow crystalline rhombic sulphur. (ii)Colloidal sulphur-\nColloidal sulphur is formed when sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3) is added hydrochloric acid to form a yellow precipitate. D. Heating Sulphur. A molecule of sulphur exists as puckered ring of eight atoms joined by covalent bonds as S8. On heating the yellow sulphur powder melts at 113oC to clear amber liquid with low viscosity and thus flows easily. On further heating to 160oC the molten liquid darkens to a brown very viscous liquid that does not flow easily. This is because the S8 rings break into S8 chain that join together to form very long chains made of over 100000 atoms of Sulphur. The long chains entangle each other reducing their mobility /flow and hence increases their viscosity. On continued further heating to above 160oC, the viscous liquid darkens but becomes more mobile/flows easily and thus less viscous. This is because the long chains break to smaller/shorter chains. At 444oC, the liquid boils and forms brown vapour of a mixture of S8 ,S6 ,S2 molecules that solidifies to S8 ring of “flowers of sulphur” on the cooler parts.

"After heating, a red glow is observed that continues even when heating is stopped.. Black solid is formed. Explanation Iron is attracted to a magnet because it is ferromagnetic. When a mixture of iron and sulphur is heated, the reaction is exothermic giving out heat energy that makes the mixture to continue glowing even after stopping heating. Black Iron(II)sulphide is formed which is a compound and thus not ferromagnetic.

Sulphur (IV)oxide gas is a colourless gas with a pungent irritating and choking smell which liquidifies easily. It is about two times denser than air. 3. The diagram below show the solubility of sulphur (IV)oxide gas. Explain."
"3. The diagram below show the solubility of sulphur (IV)oxide gas. Explain. Sulphur(IV) oxide is very soluble in water. One drop of water dissolves all the Sulphur (IV) oxide in the flask leaving a vacuum. If the clip is removed, atmospheric pressure forces the water up through the narrow tube to form a fountain to occupy the vacuum. An acidic solution of sulphuric (IV)acid is formed which turns litmus solution red. Chemical equation\nSO2(g) + H2O(l)-> H2 SO3 (aq) ( sulphuric(IV)acid turn litmus red)\n4.Dry litmus papers and wet/damp/moist litmus papers were put in a gas jar containing sulphur(IV) oxide gas. State and explain the observations made. Observations\n(i)Dry Blue litmus paper remains blue. Dry red litmus paper remains red. (ii) Wet/damp/moist blue litmus paper turns red. Moist/damp/wet red litmus paper remains red. Both litmus papers are then bleached /decolorized. Explanation\nDry sulphur(IV) oxide gas is a molecular compound that does not dissociate/ionize to release H+(aq)ions and thus has no effect on dry blue/red litmus papers. Wet/damp/moist litmus papers contain water that dissolves /react with dry sulphur(IV) oxide gas to form a solution of weak sulphuric(IV)acid (H2 SO3 (aq)). Weak sulphuric(IV)acid(H2 SO3 (aq)) dissociates /ionizes into free H+(aq)ions:\nH2 SO3 (aq) -> 2H+(aq) + SO32- (aq)\nThe free H+(aq)ions are responsible for turning blue litmus paper turns red showing the gas is acidic. The SO32- (aq) ions in wet/damp/moist sulphur(IV) oxide gas is responsible for many reactions of the gas. It is easily/readily oxidized to sulphate(VI) SO42- (aq) ions making sulphur(IV) oxide gas act as a reducing agent as in the following examples:\n(a)Bleaching agent\nWet/damp/moist coloured flowers/litmus papers are bleached/decolorized when put in sulphur(IV) oxide gas."
"Weak sulphuric(IV)acid(H2 SO3 (aq)) dissociates /ionizes into free H+(aq)ions:\nH2 SO3 (aq) -> 2H+(aq) + SO32- (aq)\nThe free H+(aq)ions are responsible for turning blue litmus paper turns red showing the gas is acidic. The SO32- (aq) ions in wet/damp/moist sulphur(IV) oxide gas is responsible for many reactions of the gas. It is easily/readily oxidized to sulphate(VI) SO42- (aq) ions making sulphur(IV) oxide gas act as a reducing agent as in the following examples:\n(a)Bleaching agent\nWet/damp/moist coloured flowers/litmus papers are bleached/decolorized when put in sulphur(IV) oxide gas. This is because sulphur(IV) oxide removes atomic oxygen from the coloured dye/ material to form sulphuric(VI)acid.

H2 SO3 (aq) + (dye) -> H2 SO4 (aq) + (dye - O)\n(coloured) (colourless)\nSulphur(IV) oxide gas therefore bleaches by reduction /removing oxygen from a dye unlike chlorine that bleaches by oxidation /adding oxygen. The bleaching by removing oxygen from Sulphur(IV) oxide gas is temporary. This is because the bleached dye regains the atomic oxygen from the atmosphere/air in presence of sunlight as catalyst thus regaining/restoring its original colour. e.g. Old newspapers turn brown on exposure to air on regaining the atomic oxygen. The bleaching through adding oxygen by chlorine gas is permanent.

(c) Uses of sulphur(VI)oxide\nOne of the main uses of sulphur(VI)oxide gas is as an intermediate product in the contact process for industrial/manufacture/large scale/production of sulphuric(VI)acid. (iii) Sulphuric(VI)acid(H2SO4)\n(a) Occurrence\nSulphuric (VI)acid(H2SO4) is one of the three mineral acids. There are three mineral acids;\nNitric(V)acid\nSulphuric(VI)acid\nHydrochloric acid. Mineral acids do not occur naturally but are prepared in a school laboratory and manufactured at industrial level. (b)The Contact process for industrial manufacture of H2SO4 . I. Raw materials\nThe main raw materials for industrial preparation of Sulphuric(VI)acid include:\n(i)Sulphur from Fraschs process or from heating metal sulphide ore like Galena(PbS),Zinc blende(ZnS)\n(ii)Oxygen from fractional distillation of air\n(iii)Water from rivers/lakes\nII. Chemical processes\nThe contact process involves four main chemical processes:\n(i)Production of Sulphur (IV)oxide\nAs one of the raw materials, Sulphur (IV)oxide gas is got from the following sources;\nI. Burning/roasting sulphur in air."

Chemical processes\nThe contact process involves four main chemical processes:\n(i)Production of Sulphur (IV)oxide\nAs one of the raw materials, Sulphur (IV)oxide gas is got from the following sources;\nI. Burning/roasting sulphur in air. Sulphur from Fraschs process is roasted/burnt in air to form Sulphur (IV)oxide gas in the burners\nChemical equation\nS(s) + O2(g) --> SO2 (g)\nII. Burning/roasting sulphide ores in air. Sulphur (IV)oxide gas is produced as a by product in extraction of some metals like:\n- Lead from Lead(II)sulphide/Galena,(PbS)\n- Zinc from zinc(II)sulphide/Zinc blende, (ZnS)\n- Copper from Copper iron sulphide/Copper pyrites, (CuFeS2)\nOn roasting/burning, large amount /quantity of sulphur(IV)oxide is generated/produced. Chemical equation\n(i)2PbS (s) + 3O2 (g) -> 2PbO(s) + 2SO2 (g)\n(ii)2ZnS (s) + 3O2 (g) -> 2ZnO(s) + 2SO2 (g)\n(ii)2CuFeS2 (s) + 4O2 (g) -> 2FeO(s) + 3SO2 (g) + Cu2O(s)\nSulphur(IV)oxide easily/readily liquefies and thus can be transported to a far distance safely. (ii)Purification of Sulphur(IV)oxide\nSulphur(IV)oxide gas contain dust particles and Arsenic(IV)oxide as impurities. These impurities “poison”/impair the catalyst by adhering on/covering its surface. The impurities are removed by electrostatic precipitation method ."
"(ii)Purification of Sulphur(IV)oxide\nSulphur(IV)oxide gas contain dust particles and Arsenic(IV)oxide as impurities. These impurities “poison”/impair the catalyst by adhering on/covering its surface. The impurities are removed by electrostatic precipitation method . In the contact process Platinum or Vanadium(V)oxide may be used. Vanadium(V)oxide is preferred because it is :\n(i) cheaper/less expensive\n(ii) less easily poisoned by impurities\n(iii)Catalytic conversion of Sulphur(IV)oxide to Sulphur(VI)oxide\nPure and dry mixture of Sulphur (IV)oxide gas and Oxygen is heated to 450oC in a heat exchanger. The heated mixture is passed through long pipes coated with pellets of Vanadium (V)oxide catalyst. The close “contact” between the reacting gases and catalyst give the process its name. Vanadium (V)oxide catalyse the conversion/oxidation of Sulphur(IV)oxide to Sulphur(VI)oxide gas. Chemical equation\n2SO2 (g) + O2(g) -- V2O5 --> 2SO2 (g)\nThis reaction is exothermic (-∆H) and the temperatures need to be maintained at around 450oC to ensure that:\n(i)reaction rate/time taken for the formation of Sulphur(VI)oxide is not too slow/long at lower temperatures below 450oC\n(ii) Sulphur(VI)oxide gas does not decompose back to Sulphur(IV)oxide gas and Oxygen gas at higher temperatures than 450oC. (iv)Conversion of Sulphur(VI)oxide of Sulphuric(VI)acid\nSulphur(VI)oxide is the acid anhydride of concentrated Sulphuric(VI)acid. Sulphur(VI)oxide reacts with water to form thick mist of fine droplets of very/highly corrosive concentrated Sulphuric(VI)acid because the reaction is highly exothermic. To prevent this, Sulphur (VI)oxide is a passed up to meet downward flow of 98% Sulphuric(VI)acid in the absorption chamber/tower."

Sulphur(VI)oxide reacts with water to form thick mist of fine droplets of very/highly corrosive concentrated Sulphuric(VI)acid because the reaction is highly exothermic. To prevent this, Sulphur (VI)oxide is a passed up to meet downward flow of 98% Sulphuric(VI)acid in the absorption chamber/tower. The reaction forms a very viscous oily liquid called Oleum/fuming Sulphuric (VI) acid/ pyrosulphuric (VI) acid. Chemical equation\nH2SO4 (aq) + SO3 (g) -> H2S2O7 (l)\nOleum/fuming Sulphuric (VI) acid/ pyrosulphuric (VI) acid is diluted carefully with distilled water to give concentrated sulphuric (VI) acid . Chemical equation\nH2S2O7 (l) + H2O (l) -> 2H2SO4 (l)\nThe acid is stored ready for market/sale. III. Environmental effects of contact process\nSulphur(VI)oxide and Sulphur(IV)oxide gases are atmospheric pollutants that form acid rain if they escape to the atmosphere. In the Contact process, about 2% of these gases do not form sulphuric (VI) acid. The following precautions prevent/minimize pollution from Contact process:\n(i)recycling back any unreacted Sulphur(IV)oxide gas back to the heat exchangers. (ii)dissolving Sulphur(VI)oxide gas in concentrated sulphuric (VI) acid instead of water. This prevents the formation of fine droplets of the corrosive/ toxic/poisonous fumes of concentrated sulphuric (VI) acid. (iii)scrubbing-This involves passing the exhaust gases through very tall chimneys lined with quicklime/calcium hydroxide solid."

Sketch chart diagram showing the Contact process\n(c) Properties of Concentrated sulphuric (VI) acid (i) Concentrated sulphuric (VI) acid is a colourless oily liquid with a density of 1.84gcm-3.It has a boiling point of 338oC. (ii) Concentrated sulphuric (VI) acid is very soluble in water. The solubility /dissolution of the acid very highly exothermic. The concentrated acid should thus be diluted slowly in excess water. Water should never be added to the acid because the hot acid scatters highly corrosive fumes out of the container. (iii) Concentrated sulphuric (VI)acid is a covalent compound. It has no free H+ ions. Free H+ ions are responsible for turning the blue litmus paper red. Concentrated sulphuric (VI) acid thus do not change the blue litmus paper red. (iv) Concentrated sulphuric (VI)acid is hygroscopic. It absorbs water from the atmosphere and do not form a solution.

Compounds that makes up living things whether alive or dead mainly contain carbon. Carbon is tetravalent. It is able to form stable covalent bonds with itself and many non-metals like hydrogen, nitrogen ,oxygen and halogens to form a variety of compounds. This is because:\n(i) carbon uses all the four valence electrons to form four strong covalent bond. (ii)carbon can covalently bond to form a single, double or triple covalent bond with itself. (iii)carbon atoms can covalently bond to form a very long chain or ring. When carbon covalently bond with Hydrogen, it forms a group of organic compounds called Hydrocarbons\nA.HYDROCARBONS (HCs)\nHydrocarbons are a group of organic compounds containing /made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms only. Depending on the type of bond that exist between the individual carbon atoms, hydrocarbon are classified as:\n(i) Alkanes\n(ii) Alkenes\n(iii) Alkynes\n(i) Alkanes\n(a)Nomenclature/Naming\nThese are hydrocarbons with a general formula CnH2n+2 where n is the number of Carbon atoms in a molecule. The carbon atoms are linked by single bond to each other and to hydrogen atoms. They include:\nNote\n1.The general formula/molecular formular of a compound shows the number of each atoms of elements making the compound e.g. Decane has a general/molecular formula C10H22 ;this means there are 10 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms in a molecule of decane. 2.The structural formula shows the arrangement/bonding of atoms of each element making the compound e.g\nDecane has the structural formula as in the table above ;this means the 1st carbon from left to right is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom."

(ii)Biogas is formed from the decay of waste organic products like animal dung and cellulose. When the decay takes place in absence of oxygen , 60-75% by volume of the gaseous mixture of methane gas is produced. (iii)Crude oil is a mixture of many flammable hydrocarbons/substances. Using fractional distillation, each hydrocarbon fraction can be separated from the other. The hydrocarbon with lower /smaller number of carbon atoms in the chain have lower boiling point and thus collected first. As the carbon chain increase, the boiling point, viscosity (ease of flow) and colour intensity increase as flammability decrease. Hydrocarbons in crude oil are not pure. They thus have no sharp fixed boiling point."

Physical properties\nAlkanes are colourless gases, solids and liquids that are not poisonous. They are slightly soluble in water. The solubility decrease as the carbon chain and thus the molar mass increase\nThe melting and boiling point increase as the carbon chain increase. This is because of the increase in van-der-waals /intermolecular forces as the carbon chain increase. The 1st four straight chain alkanes (methane,ethane,propane and butane)are therefore gases ,the nect six(pentane ,hexane, heptane,octane,nonane, and decane) are liquids while the rest from unidecane(11 carbon atoms) are solids ."

Alkanes react with halogens in presence of ultraviolet light to form halogenoalkanes. During substitution:\n(i)the halogen molecule is split into free atom/radicals. (ii)one free halogen radical/atoms knock /remove one hydrogen from the alkane leaving an alkyl radical. (iii) the alkyl radical combine with the other free halogen atom/radical to form halogenoalkane. (iv)the chlorine atoms substitute repeatedly in the alkane. Each substitution removes a hydrogen atom from the alkane and form hydrogen halide. (v)substitution stops when all the hydrogen in alkanes are replaced with halogens. Substitution reaction is a highly explosive reaction in presence of sunlight / ultraviolet light that act as catalyst.

"(b)Isomers of alkenes\nIsomers are alkenes lie alkanes have the same molecular general formula but different molecular structural formula. Ethene and propene do not form isomers. Isomers of alkenes are also named by using the IUPAC(International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system of nomenclature/naming. The IUPAC system of nomenclature of naming alkenes uses the following basic rules/guidelines:\n1.Identify the longest continuous/straight carbon chain which contains the =C = C= double bond get/determine the parent alkene. 2.Number the longest chain form the end of the chain which contains the =C = C= double bond so he =C = C= double bond lowest number possible. 3 Indicate the positions by splitting “alk-positions-ene” e.g. but-2-ene, pent-1,3-diene. 4.The position indicated must be for the carbon atom at the lower position in the =C = C= double bond.i.e\nBut-2-ene means the double =C = C= is between Carbon “2”and “3”\nPent-1,3-diene means there are two double bond one between carbon “1” and “2”and another between carbon “3” and “4”\n5. Determine the position, number and type of branches. Name them as methyl, ethyl, propyl e.tc. according to the number of alkyl carbon chains attached to the alkene. Name them fluoro-,chloro-,bromo-,iodo- if they are halogens\n6.Use prefix di-,tri-,tetra-,penta-,hexa- to show the number of double C = C bonds and branches attached to the alkene. 7.Position isomers can be formed when the=C = C= double bond is shifted between carbon atoms e.g. But-2-ene means the double =C = C= is between Carbon “2”and “3”\nBut-1-ene means the double =C = C= is between Carbon “1”and “2”\nBoth But-1-ene and But-2-ene are position isomers of Butene\n8.Position isomers are molecules/compounds having the same general formular but different position of the functional group.i.e."

Like alkanes ,an alkyl group can be attached to the alkene. Chain/branch isomers are thus formed. 10.Chain/branch isomers are molecules/compounds having the same general formula but different structural formula e.g\nButene and 2-methyl propene both have the same general formualr but different branching chain.

(ii)Using aluminium(III)oxide\n(e)Properties of alkenes\nI. Physical properties\nLike alkanes, alkenes are colourles gases, solids and liquids that are not poisonous. They are slightly soluble in water. The solubility in water decrease as the carbon chain and as the molar mass increase but very soluble in organic solvents like tetrachloromethane and methylbenzene. The melting and boiling point increase as the carbon chain increase. This is because of the increase in van-der-waals /intermolecular forces as the carbon chain increase. The 1st four straight chain alkenes (ethene,propane,but-1-ene and pent-1-ene)are gases at room temperature and pressure. The density of straight chain alkenes,like alkanes, increase with increasing carbon chain as the intermolecular forces increases reducing the volume occupied by a given mass of the alkene. Summary of physical properties of the 1st five alkenes\nII. Chemical properties\n(a)Burning/combustion\nAlkenes burn with a yellow/ luminous sooty/ smoky flame in excess air to form carbon(IV) oxide and water."

(d)Some uses of Alkenes\n1. In the manufacture of plastic\n2. Hydrolysis of ethene is used in industrial manufacture of ethanol. 3. In ripening of fruits. 4. In the manufacture of detergents. (iii) Alkynes\n(a)Nomenclature/Naming\nThese are hydrocarbons with a general formula CnH2n-2 and C C double bond as the functional group . n is the number of Carbon atoms in the molecule. The carbon atoms are linked by at least one triple bond to each other and single bonds to hydrogen atoms. They include:\nNote\n1. Since carbon is tetravalent ,each atom of carbon in the alkyne MUST always be bonded using four covalent bond /four shared pairs of electrons including at the triple bond. 2. Since Hydrogen is monovalent ,each atom of hydrogen in the alkyne MUST always be bonded using one covalent bond/one shared pair of electrons. 3."
"2. Since Hydrogen is monovalent ,each atom of hydrogen in the alkyne MUST always be bonded using one covalent bond/one shared pair of electrons. 3. One member of the alkyne ,like alkenes and alkanes, differ from the next/previous by a CH2 group(molar mass of 14 atomic mass units).They thus form a homologous series. e.g\nPropyne differ from ethyne by (14 a.m.u) one carbon and two Hydrogen atoms from ethyne. 4.A homologous series of alkenes like that of alkanes:\n(i) differ by a CH2 group from the next /previous consecutively\n(ii) have similar chemical properties\n(iii)have similar chemical formula with general formula CnH2n-2\n(iv)the physical properties also show steady gradual change\n5.The - C = C - triple bond in alkyne is the functional group. The functional group is the reacting site of the alkynes. 6. The - C = C - triple bond in alkyne can easily be broken to accommodate more /four more monovalent atoms. The - C = C - triple bond in alkynes make it thus unsaturated like alkenes. 7. Most of the reactions of alkynes like alkenes take place at the - C = C- triple bond. (b)Isomers of alkynes\nIsomers of alkynes have the same molecular general formula but different molecular structural formula. Isomers of alkynes are also named by using the IUPAC(International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system of nomenclature/naming. The IUPAC system of nomenclature of naming alkynes uses the following basic rules/guidelines:\n1.Identify the longest continuous/straight carbon chain which contains the - C = C- triple bond to get/determine the parent alkene. 2. Number the longest chain form the end of the chain which contains the -C = C- triple bond so as - C = C- triple bond get lowest number possible. 3 Indicate the positions by splitting “alk-positions-yne” e.g. but-2-yne, pent-1,3-diyne. 4.The position indicated must be for the carbon atom at the lower position in the\n-C = C- triple bond."
"3 Indicate the positions by splitting “alk-positions-yne” e.g. but-2-yne, pent-1,3-diyne. 4.The position indicated must be for the carbon atom at the lower position in the\n-C = C- triple bond. i.e\nBut-2-yne means the triple -C = C- is between Carbon “2”and “3”\nPent-1,3-diyne means there are two triple bonds; one between carbon “1” and “2”and another between carbon “3” and “4”\n5. Determine the position, number and type of branches. Name them as methyl, ethyl, propyl e.tc. according to the number of alkyl carbon chains attached to the alkyne. Name them fluoro-,chloro-,bromo-,iodo- if they are halogens\n6.Use prefix di-,tri-,tetra-,penta-,hexa- to show the number of triple - C = C- bonds and branches attached to the alkyne. 7.Position isomers can be formed when the - C = C- triple bond is shifted between carbon atoms e.g. But-2-yne means the double - C = C- is between Carbon “2”and “3”\nBut-1-yne means the double - C = C- is between Carbon “1”and “2”\nBoth But-1-yne and But-2-yne are position isomers of Butyne. 9. Like alkanes and alkynes , an alkyl group can be attached to the alkyne. Chain/branch isomers are thus formed. Butyne and 2-methyl propyne both have the same general formular but different branching chain. (c)Preparation of Alkynes. Ethyne is prepared from the reaction of water on calcium carbide. The reaction is highly exothermic and thus a layer of sand should be put above the calcium carbide to absorb excess heat to prevent the reaction flask from breaking. Copper(II)sulphate(VI) is used to catalyze the reaction\nChemical equation\nCaC2(s) + 2 H2O(l) -> Ca(OH) 2 (aq) + C2H2 (g)\n(d)Properties of alkynes\nI. Physical properties\nLike alkanes and alkenes, alkynes are colourles gases, solids and liquids that are not poisonous."

Physical properties\nLike alkanes and alkenes, alkynes are colourles gases, solids and liquids that are not poisonous. They are slightly soluble in water. The solubility in water decrease as the carbon chain and as the molar mass increase but very soluble in organic solvents like tetrachloromethane and methylbenzene. Ethyne has a pleasant taste when pure. The melting and boiling point increase as the carbon chain increase. This is because of the increase in van-der-waals /intermolecular forces as the carbon chain increase. The 1st three straight chain alkynes (ethyne,propyne and but-1-yne)are gases at room temperature and pressure. The density of straight chain alkynes increase with increasing carbon chain as the intermolecular forces increases reducing the volume occupied by a given mass of the alkyne. Summary of physical properties of the 1st five alkenes\nII.

Alkyne + Air -> carbon(II) oxide /carbon+ water (limited air)\nBurning of alkynes with a yellow/ luminous sooty/ smoky flame is a confirmatory test for the presence of the - C = C – triple bond because they have very high C:H ratio.

LABORATORY PREPARATION OF ALKANOLS. For decades the world over, people have been fermenting grapes juice, sugar, carbohydrates and starch to produce ethanol as a social drug for relaxation.

"LABORATORY PREPARATION OF ALKANOLS. For decades the world over, people have been fermenting grapes juice, sugar, carbohydrates and starch to produce ethanol as a social drug for relaxation. In large amount, drinking of ethanol by mammals /human beings causes mental and physical lack of coordination. Prolonged intake of ethanol causes permanent mental and physical lack of coordination because it damages vital organs like the liver. Fermentation is the reaction where sugar is converted to alcohol/alkanol using biological catalyst/enzymes in yeast. It involves three processes:\n(i)Conversion of starch to maltose using the enzyme diastase. (C6H10O5)n (s) + H2O(l) --diastase enzyme --> C12H22O11(aq)\n(Starch) (Maltose)\n(ii)Hydrolysis of Maltose to glucose using the enzyme maltase. C12H22O11(aq)+ H2O(l) -- maltase enzyme -->2 C6H12O6(aq)\n(Maltose) (glucose)\n(iii)Conversion of glucose to ethanol and carbon(IV)oxide gas using the enzyme zymase. C6H12O6(aq) -- zymase enzyme --> 2 C2H5OH(aq) + 2CO2(g)\n(glucose) (Ethanol)\nAt concentration greater than 15% by volume, the ethanol produced kills the yeast enzyme stopping the reaction. To increases the concentration, fractional distillation is done to produce spirits (e.g. Brandy=40% ethanol). Methanol is much more poisonous /toxic than ethanol. Taken large quantity in small quantity it causes instant blindness and liver, killing the consumer victim within hours. School laboratory preparation of ethanol from fermentation of glucose\nMeasure 100cm3 of pure water into a conical flask. Add about five spatula end full of glucose. Stir the mixture to dissolve. Add about one spatula end full of yeast. Set up the apparatus as below. Preserve the mixture for about three days. D.PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKANOLS\nUse the prepared sample above for the following experiments that shows the characteristic properties of alkanols\nRole of yeast\nYeast is a single cell fungus which contains the enzyme maltase and zymase that catalyse the fermentation process. Observations in lime water."
"Preserve the mixture for about three days. D.PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKANOLS\nUse the prepared sample above for the following experiments that shows the characteristic properties of alkanols\nRole of yeast\nYeast is a single cell fungus which contains the enzyme maltase and zymase that catalyse the fermentation process. Observations in lime water. A white precipitate is formed that dissolve to a colourless solution later. Lime water/Calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon(IV)0xide produced during the fermentation to form insoluble calcium carbonate and water. More carbon (IV)0xide produced during fermentation react with the insoluble calcium carbonate and water to form soluble calcium hydrogen carbonate. Ca(OH)2(aq)+ CO2 (g)-> CaCO3(s)\nH2O(l) + CO2 (g) +CaCO3(s) -> Ca(HCO3) 2 (aq)\n(c)Effects on litmus paper\nExperiment\nTake the prepared sample and test with both blue and red litmus papers. Repeat the same with pure ethanol and methylated spirit. Sample Observation table\nExplanation\nAlkanols are neutral compounds/solution that have characteristic sweet smell and taste. They have no effect on both blue and red litmus papers. (d)Solubility in water. Experiment\nPlace about 5cm3 of prepared sample into a clean test tube Add equal amount of distilled water. Repeat the same with pure ethanol and methylated spirit. Observation\nNo layers formed between the two liquids. Explanation\nEthanol is miscible in water.Both ethanol and water are polar compounds . The solubility of alkanols decrease with increase in the alkyl chain/molecular mass. The alkyl group is insoluble in water while –OH functional group is soluble in water. As the molecular chain becomes longer ,the effect of the alkyl group increases as the effect of the functional group decreases. e)Melting/boiling point. Experiment\nPlace pure ethanol in a long boiling tube .Determine its boiling point. Observation\nPure ethanol has a boiling point of 78oC at sea level/one atmosphere pressure. Explanation\nThe melting and boiling point of alkanols increase with increase in molecular chain/mass . This is because the intermolecular/van-der-waals forces of attraction between the molecules increase. More heat energy is thus required to weaken the longer chain during melting and break during boiling."

This is because the intermolecular/van-der-waals forces of attraction between the molecules increase. More heat energy is thus required to weaken the longer chain during melting and break during boiling. f)Density\nDensity of alkanols increase with increase in the intermolecular/van-der-waals forces of attraction between the molecule, making it very close to each other. This reduces the volume occupied by the molecule and thus increase the their mass per unit volume (density). Summary table showing the trend in physical properties of alkanols\ng)Burning\nExperiment\nPlace the prepared sample in a watch glass. Ignite. Repeat with pure ethanol and methylated spirit. Observation/Explanation\nFermentation produce ethanol with a lot of water(about a ratio of 1:3)which prevent the alcohol from igniting. Pure ethanol and methylated spirit easily catch fire / highly flammable. They burn with an almost colourless non-sooty/non-smoky blue flame to form carbon(IV) oxide (in excess air/oxygen)or carbon(II) oxide (limited air) and water. Ethanol is thus a saturated compound like alkanes."

Esters derive their names from the alkanol first then alkanoic acids. The alkanol “becomes” an alkyl group and the alkanoic acid “becomes” alkanoate hence alkylalkanoate. e.g. Ethanol + Ethanoic acid -> Ethylethanoate + Water\nEthanol + Propanoic acid -> Ethylpropanoate + Water\nEthanol + Methanoic acid -> Ethylmethanoate + Water\nEthanol + butanoic acid -> Ethylbutanoate + Water\nPropanol + Ethanoic acid->Propylethanoate+ Water\nMethanol+Ethanoic acid->Methyethanoate + Water\nMethanol+Decanoic acid->Methyldecanoate + Water\nDecanol +Methanoic acid->Decylmethanoate + Water\nDuring the formation of the ester, the “O” joining the alkanol and alkanoic acid comes from the alkanol.

Differences in melting and boiling point with Hydrocarbons\nAlkanos have higher melting point than the corresponding hydrocarbon (alkane/alkene/alkyne)\nThis is because most alkanols exist as dimer.A dimer is a molecule made up of two other molecules joined usually by van-der-waals forces/hydrogen bond or dative bonding. Two alkanol molecules form a dimer joined by hydrogen bonding. Example\nIn Ethanol the oxygen atom attracts/pulls the shared electrons in the covalent bond more to itself than Hydrogen. This creates a partial negative charge (δ-) on oxygen and partial positive charge(δ+) on hydrogen. Two ethanol molecules attract each other at the partial charges through Hydrogen bonding forming a dimmer.

(B) ISOMERS OF ALKANOIC ACIDS. lkanoic acids exhibit both structural and position isomerism. The isomers are named by using the following basic guidelines\n(i)Like alkanes. identify the longest carbon chain to be the parent name. (ii)Identify the position of the -C-O-H functional group to give it the smallest\nO\n/lowest position. (iii)Identify the type and position of the side group branches.

I.Physical properties of alkanoic acids\nThe table below shows some physical properties of alkanoic acids\nFrom the table note the following:\nMelting and boiling point decrease as the carbon chain increases due to increase in intermolecular forces of attraction between the molecules requiring more energy to separate the molecules. The density decreases as the carbon chain increases as the intermolecular forces of attraction increases between the molecules making the molecule very close reducing their volume in unit mass. Solubility decreases as the carbon chain increases as the soluble –COOH end is shielded by increasing insoluble alkyl/hydrocarbon chain. Like alkanols ,alkanoic acids exist as dimmers due to the hydrogen bonds within the molecule. i.e..

Filter of /decant and wash off the residue with distilled water .Transfer the clean residue into a dry beaker. Preserve. The action of soap\nSoapy detergents:\n(i)act by reducing the surface tension of water by forming a thin layer on top of the water. (ii)is made of a non-polar alkyl /hydrocarbon tail and a polar -COO-Na+ head. The non-polar alkyl /hydrocarbon tail is hydrophobic (water hating) and thus does not dissolve in water .It dissolves in non-polar solvent like grease, oil and fat. The polar -COO-Na+ head is hydrophilic (water loving)and thus dissolve in water. When washing with soapy detergent, the non-polar tail of the soapy detergent surround/dissolve in the dirt on the garment /grease/oil while the polar head dissolve in water. Through mechanical agitation/stirring/sqeezing/rubbing/beating/kneading, some grease is dislodged/lifted of the surface of the garment. It is immediately surrounded by more soap molecules It float and spread in the water as tiny droplets that scatter light in form of emulsion making the water cloudy and shinny. It is removed from the garment by rinsing with fresh water. The repulsion of the soap head prevent /ensure the droplets do not mix. Once removed, the dirt molecules cannot be redeposited back because it is surrounded by soap molecules. Advantages and disadvantages of using soapy detergents\nSoapy detergents are biodegradable. They are acted upon by bacteria and rot. They thus do not cause environmental pollution. Soapy detergents have the disadvantage in that:\n(i)they are made from fat and oils which are better eaten as food than make soap."
"They are acted upon by bacteria and rot. They thus do not cause environmental pollution. Soapy detergents have the disadvantage in that:\n(i)they are made from fat and oils which are better eaten as food than make soap. (ii)forms an insoluble precipitate with hard water called scum. Scum is insoluble calcium octadecanoate and Magnesium octadecanoate formed when soap reacts with Ca2+ and Mg2+ present in hard water. Chemical equation\n2C17H35COO- Na+ (aq) + Ca2+(aq) ->(C17H35COO- )Ca2+ (s) + 2Na+(aq)\n(insoluble Calcium octadecanote/scum)\n2C17H35COO- Na+ (aq) + Mg2+(aq) ->(C17H35COO- )Mg2+ (s) + 2Na+(aq)\n(insoluble Magnesium octadecanote/scum)\nThis causes wastage of soap. Potassium soaps are better than Sodium soap. Potassium is more expensive than sodium and thus its soap is also more expensive. (b)SOAPLESS DETERGENTS\nSoapless detergent usually called detergent is a long chain salt fromed from by-products of fractional distillation of crude oil.Commonly used soaps include:\n(i)washing agents\n(ii)toothpaste\n(iii)emulsifiers/wetting agents/shampoo\nSoapless detergents are derived from reacting:\n(i)concentrated sulphuric(VI)acid with a long chain alkanol e.g. Octadecanol(18 carbon alkanol) to form alkyl hydrogen sulphate(VI)\nAlkanol + Conc sulphuric(VI)acid -> alkyl hydrogen sulphate(VI) + Water\nR –OH + H2SO4 -> R –O-SO3H + H2O\n(ii)the alkyl hydrogen sulphate(VI) is then neutralized with sodium/potassium hydroxide to form sodium/potassium alkyl hydrogen sulphate(VI)\nSodium/potassium alkyl hydrogen sulphate(VI) is the soapless detergent."

The tiny droplets of dirt emulsion makes the water cloudy. On rinsing the cloudy emulsion is washed away. Advantages and disadvantages of using soapless detergents\nSoapless detergents are non-biodegradable unlike soapy detergents. They persist in water during sewage treatment by causing foaming in rivers ,lakes and streams leading to marine /aquatic death. Soapless detergents have the advantage in that they:\n(i)do not form scum with hard water. (ii)are cheap to manufacture/buying\n(iii)are made from petroleum products but soapis made from fats/oil for human consumption. Sample revision questions\n1. Study the scheme below\n(a)Identify the process\nSaponification\n(b)Fats and oils are esters."

"POLYMERS AND FIBRES\nPolymers and fibres are giant molecules of organic compounds. Polymers and fibres are formed when small molecules called monomers join together to form large molecules called polymers at high temperatures and pressures. This process is called polymerization. Polymers and fibres are either:\n(a)Natural polymers and fibres\n(b)Synthetic polymers and fibres\nNatural polymers and fibres are found in living things(plants and animals) Natural polymers/fibres include:\n-proteins/polypeptides making amino acids in animals\n-cellulose that make cotton,wool,paper and silk\n-Starch that come from glucose\n-Fats and oils\n-Rubber from latex in rubber trees. Synthetic polymers and fibres are man-made. They include:\n-polyethene\n-polychloroethene\n-polyphenylethene(polystyrene)\n-Terylene(Dacron)\n-Nylon-6,6\n-Perspex(artificial glass)\nSynthetic polymers and fibres have the following characteristic advantages over natural polymers\n1. They are light and portable\n2. They are easy to manufacture. 3. They can easily be molded into shape of choice. 4. They are resistant to corrosion, water, air , acids, bases and salts. 5. They are comparatively cheap, affordable, colourful and aesthetic\nSynthetic polymers and fibres however have the following disadvantages over natural polymers\nThey are non-biodegradable and hence cause environmental pollution during disposal\nThey give out highly poisonous gases when burnt like chlorine/carbon(II)oxide\nSome on burning produce Carbon(IV)oxide. Carbon(IV)oxide is a green house gas that cause global warming. Compared to some metals, they are poor conductors of heat,electricity and have lower tensile strength. To reduce environmental pollution from synthetic polymers and fibres, the followitn methods of disposal should be used:\n1.Recycling: Once produced all synthetic polymers and fibres should be recycled to a new product. This prevents accumulation of the synthetic polymers and fibres in the environment. 2.Production of biodegradable synthetic polymers and fibres that rot away."

There are two types of polymerization:\n(a)addition polymerization\n(b)condensation polymerization\n(a)addition polymerization\nAddition polymerization is the process where a small unsaturated monomer (alkene ) molecule join together to form a large saturated molecule. Only alkenes undergo addition polymerization. Addition polymers are named from the alkene/monomer making the polymer and adding the prefix “poly” before the name of monomer to form a polyalkene\nDuring addition polymerization\n(i)the double bond in alkenes break\n(ii)free radicals are formed\n(iii)the free radicals collide with each other and join to form a larger molecule. The more collisions the larger the molecule. Examples of addition polymerization\n1.Formation of Polyethene\nPolyethene is an addition polymer formed when ethene molecule/monomer join together to form a large molecule/polymer at high temperatures and pressure.

The units are not interconvertible but Pascals(Pa) are equal to Newton per metre squared(Nm-2). The standard pressure is the atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure is equal to about:\n(i)101325 Pa\n(ii)101325 Nm-2\n(iii)760 mmHg\n(iv)76 cmHg\n(v)one atmosphere. 5. Molecules of gases are always in continuous random motion at high speed. This motion is affected by the physical conditions of temperature and pressure. Physical conditions change the volume occupied by gases in a closed system. The effect of physical conditions of temperature and pressure was investigated and expressed in both Boyles and Charles laws. 6. Boyles law states that\n“the volume of a fixed mass of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure at constant/fixed temperature ”\nMathematically:\nVolume α 1 (Fixed /constant Temperature)\nPressure\nV α 1 (Fixed /constant T) ie PV = Constant(k)\nP\nFrom Boyles law , an increase in pressure of a gas cause a decrease in volume. i.e doubling the pressure cause the volume to be halved. Graphically therefore a plot of volume(V) against pressure (P) produces a curve. V\nP\nGraphically a plot of volume(V) against inverse/reciprocal of pressure (1/p) produces a straight line\nV\n1/P\nFor two gases then P1 V1 = P2 V2\nP1 = Pressure of gas 1\nV1 = Volume of gas 1\nP2 = Pressure of gas 2\nV2 = Volume of gas 2\nPractice examples:\n1. A fixed mass of gas at 102300Pa pressure has a volume of 25cm3.Calculate its volume if the pressure is doubled. Working\nP1 V1 = P2 V2 Substituting :102300 x 25 = (102300 x 2) x V2\nV2 = 102300 x 25 = 12.5cm3\n(102300 x 2)\n2. Calculate the pressure which must be applied to a fixed mass of 100cm3 of Oxygen for its volume to triple at 100000Nm-2."

Will the ballon reach stratosphere where the pressure is 90000Pa?

Gases expand/increase by 1/273 by volume on heating.Gases contact/decrease by 1/273 by volume on cooling at constant/fixed pressure. The volume of a gas continue decreasing with decrease in temperature until at -273oC /0 K the volume is zero. i.e. there is no gas. This temperature is called absolute zero. It is the lowest temperature at which a gas can exist. Graphically therefore a plot of volume(V) against Temperature(T) in:\n(i)oC produces a straight line that is extrapolated to the absolute zero of -273oC ."

The balloon thus remained intact. 8. The continuous random motion of gases differ from gas to the other.The movement of molecules (of a gas) from region of high concentration to a region of low concentration is called diffusion. The rate of diffusion of a gas depends on its density. i.e. The higher the rate of diffusion, the less dense the gas. The density of a gas depends on its molar mass/relative molecular mass. i.e. The higher the density the higher the molar mass/relative atomic mass and thus the lower the rate of diffusion. Examples\n1.Carbon (IV)oxide(CO2) has a molar mass of 44g.Nitrogen(N2)has a molar mass of 28g. (N2)is thus lighter/less dense than Carbon (IV)oxide(CO2). N2 diffuses faster than CO2. 2.Ammonia(NH3) has a molar mass of 17g.Nitrogen(N2)has a molar mass of 28g. (N2)is thus about twice lighter/less dense than Ammonia(NH3). Ammonia(NH3) diffuses twice faster than N2. 3. Ammonia(NH3) has a molar mass of 17g.Hydrogen chloride gas has a molar mass of 36.5g.Both gases on contact react to form white fumes of ammonium chloride .When a glass/cotton wool dipped in ammonia and another glass/cotton wool dipped in hydrochloric acid are placed at opposite ends of a glass tube, both gases diffuse towards each other. A white disk appears near to glass/cotton wool dipped in hydrochloric acid. This is because hydrogen chloride is heavier/denser than Ammonia and thus its rate of diffusion is lower . The rate of diffusion of a gas is in accordance to Grahams law of diffusion."
"A white disk appears near to glass/cotton wool dipped in hydrochloric acid. This is because hydrogen chloride is heavier/denser than Ammonia and thus its rate of diffusion is lower . The rate of diffusion of a gas is in accordance to Grahams law of diffusion. Grahams law states that:\n“the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its density, at the same/constant/fixed temperature and pressure”\nMathematically\nR α 1 and since density is proportional to mass then R α 1\n√ p√ m\nFor two gases then:\nR1 = R2 where: R1 and R2 is the rate of diffusion of 1st and 2nd gas. √M2 √M1 M1 and M2 is the molar mass of 1st and 2nd gas. Since rate is inverse of time. i.e. the higher the rate the less the time:\nFor two gases then:\nT1 = T2 where: T1 and T2 is the time taken for 1st and 2nd gas to diffuse. √M1 √M2 M1 and M2 is the molar mass of 1st and 2nd gas. Practice examples:\n1. It takes 30 seconds for 100cm3 of carbon(IV)oxide to diffuse across a porous plate. How long will it take 150cm3 of nitrogen(IV)oxide to diffuse across the same plate under the same conditions of temperature and pressure."
"How long would 200cm3 of Hydrogen chloride take to diffuse through a porous plug if carbon(IV)oxide takes 200seconds to diffuse through. Molar mass CO2 = 44g Molar mass HCl = 36.5g\nT CO2 = √ molar mass CO2 => 200 seconds = √ 44.0\nT HCl √ molar mass HCl T HCl √ 36.5\nT HCl = 200seconds x √ 36.5= 182.1588 seconds\n√ 44.0\n3. Oxygen gas takes 250 seconds to diffuse through a porous diaphragm. Calculate the molar mass of gas Z which takes 227 second to diffuse. Molar mass O2 = 32g Molar mass Z = x g\nT O2 = √ molar mass O2 => 250 seconds = √ 32.0\nT Z √ molar mass Z 227seconds √ x\n√ x = 227seconds x √ 32= 26.3828 grams\n250\n4. 25cm3 of carbon(II)oxide diffuses across a porous plate in 25seconds. How long will it take 75cm3 of Carbon(IV)oxide to diffuse across the same plate under the same conditions of temperature and pressure."

The Avogadros Constant contain 6.023 x10 23 particles. i.e. 1mole = 6.023 x10 23 particles = 6.023 x10 23\n2 moles = 2 x 6.023 x10 23 particles= 1.205 x10 24\n0.2 moles = 0.2 x 6.023 x10 23 particles= 1.205 x10 22\n0.0065 moles = 0.0065 x 6.023 x10 23 particles = 3.914 x10 21\n3. The mass of one mole of a substance is called molar mass. The molar mass of:\n(i)an element has mass equal to relative atomic mass /RAM(in grams)of the element e.g. Molar mass of carbon(C)= relative atomic mass = 12.0g\n6.023 x10 23 particles of carbon = 1 mole =12.0 g\nMolar mass of sodium(Na) = relative atomic mass = 23.0g\n6.023 x10 23 particles of sodium = 1 mole =23.0 g\nMolar mass of Iron (Fe) = relative atomic mass = 56.0g\n6.023 x10 23 particles of iron = 1 mole =56.0 g\n(ii)a molecule has mass equal to relative molecular mass /RMM (in grams)of the molecule. Relative molecular mass is the sum of the relative atomic masses of the elements making the molecule. The number of atoms making a molecule is called atomicity. Most gaseous molecules are diatomic (e.g. O2, H2, N2, F2, Cl2, Br2, I2)noble gases are monoatomic(e.g. He, Ar, Ne, Xe),Ozone gas(O3) is triatomic e.g."

Titration generally involves filling a burette with known/unknown concentration of a solution then adding the solution to unknown/known concentration of another solution in a conical flask until there is complete reaction. If the solutions used are both colourless, an indicator is added to the conical flask. When the reaction is over, a slight/little excess of burette contents change the colour of the indicator. This is called the end point. Set up of titration apparatus\nThe titration process involve involves determination of titre. The titre is the volume of burette contents/reading before and after the end point. Burette contents/reading before titration is usually called the Initial burette reading. Burette contents/reading after titration is usually called the Final burette reading. The titre value is thus a sum of the Final less Initial burette readings. To reduce errors, titration process should be repeated at least once more. The results of titration are recorded in a titration table as below\nSample titration table\nAs evidence of a titration actually done examining body requires the candidate to record their burette readings before and after the titration.

(b) pH is a measure of H+(aq) concentration in a solution. The higher the H+(aq)ions concentration ;\n-the higher the acidity\n-the lower the pH\n-the lower the concentration of OH-(aq)\n-the lower the alkalinity\nAt pH 7 , a solution has equal concentration of H+(aq) and OH-(aq). Beyond pH 7,the concentration of the OH-(aq) increases as the H+(aq) ions decreases. 10.(a) When acids /bases dissolve in water, the ions present in the solution conduct electricity. The more the dissociation the higher the yield of ions and the greater the electrical conductivity of the solution. A compound that conducts electricity in an electrolyte and thus a compound showing high electrical conductivity is a strong electrolyte while a compound showing low electrical conductivity is a weak electrolyte.

Summary flow diagram showing the extraction of Soda ash from Trona\n23.Extraction of common salt from Indian Ocean at Ngomeni in Kenya\nOceans are salty.They contain a variety of dissolved salts (about 77% being sodium chloride). During high tide ,water is collected into shallow pods and allowed to crystallize as evaporation takes place.The pods are constructed in series to increase the rate of evaporation. At the final pod ,the crystals are scapped together,piled in a heap and washed with brine (concentrated sodium chloride). It contains MgCl2 and CaCl2 . MgCl2 and CaCl2are hygroscopic. They absorb water from the atmosphere and form a solution. This makes table salt damp/wet on exposure to the atmosphere. 24.Some water form lather easily with soap while others do not. Water which form lather easily with soap is said to be “soft”\nWater which do not form lather easily with soap is said to be “hard”\nHardness of water is caused by the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions.

For KCSE candidates burette readings must be recorded in a titration table in the format provided by the Kenya National Examination Council. As evidence of all titration actually done Kenya National Examination Council require the candidate to record their burette readings before and after the titration to complete the titration table in the format provided. Sample Titration table format\nCalculate the average volume of solution used\n24.0 + 24.0 + 24.0 = 24.0 cm3\n3\nAs evidence of understanding the degree of accuracy of burettes ,all readings must be recorded to a decimal point. As evidence of accuracy in carrying the out the titration ,candidates value should be within 0.2 of the school value . The school value is the teachers readings presented to the examining body/council based on the concentrations of the solutions s/he presented to her/his candidates. Bonus mark is awarded for averaged reading within 0.1 school value as Final answer. Calculations involved after the titration require candidates thorough practice mastery on the:\n(i)relationship among the mole, molar mass, mole ratios, concentration, molarity. (ii) mathematical application of 1st principles. Very useful information which candidates forget appear usually in the beginning of the paper as:\n“You are provided with…”\nAll calculation must be to the 4th decimal point unless they divide fully to a lesser decimal point.

"Never round off answers. b)Thermochemistry/energy changes\nEnergy is the capacity to do work which is measured in Joules(J) or(kJ) . Chemical/physical changes take place with absorption (Endothermic ) or evolution/ production (Exothermic)of heat. Practically:\n(i)endothermic changes show absorption of heat by a fall / drop in temperature and has a +∆H\n(ii)exothermic changes show evolution/ production of heat by a rise in temperature and has a -∆H\n(iii)temperature is measure using a thermometer. (iv)a school thermometer is either coloured (alcohol) or colourless(mercury)\n(v) For accuracy ,candidates in the same practical session should use the same type of thermometer. (vi) fall / drop (+∆H) in temperature is movement of thermometer level downward. (vii) rise (-∆H) in temperature is movement of thermometer level upwards. Physical changes changes mainly involve melting/freezing/fussion and boiling /vapourization. Chemical changes changes mainly involve displacement ,dissolving , neutralization\na).Energy changes in physical processes\nMelting/freezing/fusion/solidification and boiling/vaporization/evaporation are the two physical processes. Melting /freezing point of pure substances is fixed /constant. The boiling point of pure substance depends on external atmospheric pressure. Melting/fusion is the physical change of a solid to liquid. Freezing/fusion is the physical change of a liquid to solid. Melting/freezing/fusion/solidification are therefore two opposite but same reversible physical processes. i.e\nA (s) ========A(l)\nBoiling/vaporization/evaporation is the physical change of a liquid to gas/vapour. Condensation/liquidification is the physical change of gas/vapour to liquid. Boiling/vaporization/evaporation and condensation/liquidification are therefore two opposite but same reversible physical processes. i.e\nB (l) ========B(g)\nPractically\nMelting/liquidification/fusion involves heating a solid to weaken the strong bonds holding the solid particles together. Solids are made up of very strong bonds holding the particles very close to each other (Kinetic Theory of matter\nOn heating these particles gain energy/heat from the surrounding heat source to form a liquid with weaker bonds holding the particles close together but with some degree of freedom."

Strong acids/bases/alkalis are completely/fully/wholly dissociated to many free ions(H+ /H3O+ and OH- ions). (ii) for strong acid/base/alkali neutralization, no energy is used to dissociate /ionize since molecule is wholly/fully dissociated/ionized into free H+ H3O+ and OH- ions. The overall energy evolved is comparatively higher / more than weak acid-base/ alkali neutralizations. For strong acid-base/alkali neutralization, the enthalpy of neutralization is constant at about 57.3kJmole-1 irrespective of the acid-base used. This is because ionically:\nOH-(aq)+ H+(aq) -> H2O(l)\nfor all wholly/fully /completely dissociated acid/base/alkali\nWeak acids/bases/alkalis are partially dissociated to few free ions(H+ (H3O+ and OH- ions) and exist more as molecules. Neutralization is an exothermic(-∆H) process. The energy produced during neutralization depend on the amount of free ions (H+ H3O+ and OH-)ions existing in the acid/base/alkali reactant:\n(i)for weak acid-base/alkali neutralization,some of the energy is used to dissociate /ionize the molecule into free H+ H3O+ and OH- ions therefore the overall energy evolved is comparatively lower/lesser/smaller than strong acid / base/ alkali neutralizations."

Practically ∆Hᶿn can be determined as in the examples below:\nTo determine the molar enthalpy of neutralization ∆Hn of Hydrochloric acid\nProcedure\nPlace 50cm3 of 2M hydrochloric acid into a calorimeter/200cm3 plastic beaker wrapped in cotton wool/tissue paper. Record its temperature T1. Using a clean measuring cylinder, measure another 50cm3 of 2M sodium hydroxide. Rinse the bulb of the thermometer in distilled water. Determine the temperature of the sodium hydroxide T2. Average T2 andT1 to get the initial temperature of the mixture T3. Carefully add all the alkali into the calorimeter/200cm3 plastic beaker wrapped in cotton wool/tissue paper containing the acid. Stir vigorously the mixture with the thermometer. Determine the highest temperature change to the nearest 0.5oC T4 as the final temperature of the mixture. Repeat the experiment to complete table 1.

"d) Physical properties of metal. Metals form giant metallic structure joined by metallic bond from electrostatic attraction between the metallic cation and free delocalized electrons. This makes metals to have the following physical properties:\n(i)High melting and boiling points\nThe giant metallic structure has a very close packed metallic lattice joined by strong electrostatic attraction between the metallic cation and free delocalized electrons.The more delocalized electrons the higher the melting/boiling points e.g. Aluminium has a melting point of about 2015oC while that of sodium is about 98oC.This is mainly because aluminium has more/three delocalized electrons than sodium/has one. Aluminium has a boiling point of about 2470oC while that of sodium is about 890oC.This is mainly because aluminium has more/three delocalized electrons than sodium/has one. (ii)High thermal and electrical conductivity\nAll metals are good thermal and electrical conductors as liquid or solids. The more delocalized electrons the higher the thermal and electrical conductivity. e.g. Aluminium has an electrical conductivity of about 3.82 x 19-9 ohms per metre. Sodium has an electrical conductivity of about 2.18 x 19-9 ohms per metre. (iii)Shiny/Lustrous\nThe free delocalized electrons on the surface of the metal absorb, vibrate and then scatter/re-emit/lose light energy. All metals are therefore usually shades of grey in colour except copper which is shiny brown.e.g. Zinc is bluish grey while iron is silvery grey. (iv)High tensile strength\nThe free delocalized electrons on the surface of the metal atoms binds the surface immediately when the metal is coiled/folded preventing it from breaking /being brittle. (v)Malleable. Metals can be made into thin sheet. The metallic crystal lattice on being beaten/pressed/hammered on two sides extend its length and width/bredth and is then immediately bound by the delocalized electrons preventing it from breaking/being brittle.

In teams of oxygen transfer:\ni) Reduction is removal of oxygen. ii) Oxidation is addition of oxygen. iii) Redox is simultaneous addition and removal of oxygen. iv) Reducing agent is the species that undergoes oxidation, therefore gains oxygen. v) Oxidizing agent is the species that undergoes reduction, therefore looses/donates oxygen. e.g. When hydrogen is passed through heated copper (II) oxide, it is oxidised to copper metal as in the equation below:\nCuO (s) + H2 (g) -> Cu (s) + H2O (l)\n(Oxidising agent) (Reducing agent)\n2.

Example\nDisplacement of metals from their solutions:\nPlace 5cm3 each of Iron (II) sulphate (VI) solution into three different test tubes. Add about 1g of copper tunings / powder into one test tube then zinc and magnesium powders separately into the other test tubes. Shake thoroughly for 2 minutes each. Record any colour changes in the table below. Explanation\n-When a more reactive metal is added to a solution of less reactive metal, it displaces it from its solution. -When a less reactive metal is added to a solution of a more reactive metal, it does not displace it from its solution. -Copper is less reactive than iron therefore cannot displace iron its solution. -Zinc is more reactive than iron therefore can displace iron from its solution. -Magnesium is more reactive than iron therefore can displace iron from its solution. In terms of electron transfer:\n- the more reactive metal undergoes oxidation (reducing agent) by donating/loosing electrons to form ions\n-the less reactive metal undergoes reduction (oxidizing agent) by its ions in solution gaining /accepting/acquiring the electrons to form the metal. -displacement of metals involves therefore electron transfer from a more reactive metal to ions of another less reactive metal."

The moles of oxygen gas at the anode is equal to the moles of copper produced at the cathode\nVI. Explain the changes in electrolyte during electrolysis of 1M copper (II) sulphate(VI) solution. (i)The pH of copper(II) sulphate(VI) solution lowers/decreases. The salt becomes more acidic. Water in the electrolyte is decomposed only into Oxygen gas (from the OH- ions) that escapes as products at the anode. There is a net accumulation of excess H+ (aq) ions in solution. This makes the electrolyte strongly acidic with low pH."
"Water in the electrolyte is decomposed only into Oxygen gas (from the OH- ions) that escapes as products at the anode. There is a net accumulation of excess H+ (aq) ions in solution. This makes the electrolyte strongly acidic with low pH. (ii) Cu2+ (aq) ions are responsible for the blue colour of the electrolyte/ copper(II) sulphate (VI) solution. As electrolysis continues, blue Cu2+ (aq) ions gain electrons to form brown Copper. The blue colour of electrolyte therefore fades/become less blue. (iii)Copper is deposited at the cathode. This increases the mass of the cathode.OH- ions that produce Oxygen gas at anode come from water. Oxygen escapes out/away without increasing the mass of anode. II. Using copper electrodes\nWeigh clean copper plates electrodes. Record the masses of the electrodes in table I below. Place the electrodes in 1M copper(II) sulphate(VI) solution in a beaker. Set up an electrolytic cell. Close the switch and pass current for about 20 minutes. Observe each electrode and any changes in electrolyte. Remove the electrodes from the electrolyte. Wash with acetone/propanone and allow them to dry. Reweigh each electrode. Sample results\nAnswer the following questions:\nI.

Name the products of electrolysis of 1M copper(II) sulphate(VI) solution using copper electrodes. Cathode-1 moles of copper metal as brown solid coat (Cathode increase/deposits)\nAnode-Anode erodes/decrease in size\nV. Explain the changes that take place during the electrolytic process\n(i)Cathode\n-Cu2+ ions are lower than H+ ions in the electrochemical series therefore selectively discharged at the cathode. Cu2+ ions have greater tendency to accept/gain/acquire electrons to form brown copper atoms/solid that deposit itself and increase the mass/size of the cathode.The copper deposited at the cathode is pure\n-H+ ions accumulate around the cathode. Electrolyte thus becomes strongly acidic around the cathode. -Cu2+ ions in solution are responsible for the blue colour of electrolyte. Blue colour of electrolyte fade around the cathode. (ii)Anode\nCopper atom at the anode easily ionizes to release electrons. The anode therefore keeps decreasing in mass/eroding."
"Blue colour of electrolyte fade around the cathode. (ii)Anode\nCopper atom at the anode easily ionizes to release electrons. The anode therefore keeps decreasing in mass/eroding. The amount of copper that dissolve/erode is equal to the mass of copper deposited. This is called electrode ionization. Electrode ionization is where the anode erodes/decrease and the cathode deposits/increase during electrolysis. The overall concentration of the electrolyte remains constant\n14.In industries electrolysis has the following uses/applications:\n(a)Extraction of reactive metals from their ores. Potassium, sodium ,magnesium, and aluminium are extracted from their ores using electrolytic methods. (b)Purifying copper after exraction from copper pyrites ores. Copper obtained from copper pyrites ores is not pure. After extraction, the copper is refined by electrolysing copper(II)sulphate(VI) solution using the impure copper as anode and a thin strip of pure copper as cathode. Electrode ionization take place there:\n(i)At the cathode; Cu2+ (aq) + 2e -> Cu(s) (Pure copper deposits on the strip\n(ii)At the anode; Cu(s) ->Cu2+ (aq) + 2e (impure copper erodes/dissolves)\n(c)Electroplating\nThe label EPNS(Electro Plated Nickel Silver) on some steel/metallic utensils mean they are plated/coated with silver and/or Nickel to improve their appearance(add their aesthetic value)and prevent/slow corrosion(rusting of iron). Electroplating is the process of coating a metal with another metal using an electric current. During electroplating,the cathode is made of the metal to be coated/impure."

(iii)-Some for of energy transfer/release/absorb from/to the environment take place. Nuclear and chemical reaction has the following differences:\n(i) Nuclear reactions mainly involve protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. Chemical reactions mainly involve outer electrons in the energy levels an atom. (ii) Nuclear reactions form a new element. Chemical reactions do not form new elements\n(iii) Nuclear reactions mainly involve evolution/production of large quantity of heat/energy. Chemical reactions produce or absorb small quantity of heat/energy. (iv)Nuclear reactions are accompanied by a loss in mass/mass defect.Do not obey the law of conservation of matter. Chemical reactions are not accompanied by a loss in mass/ mass defect hence obey the law of conservation of matter. (v)The rate of decay/ disintegration of the nuclide is independent of physical conditions (temperature/pressure /purityp/article size)\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is dependent on physical conditions (temperature/pressure/purity/particle size/ surface area)\nE: APPLICATION AND USES OF RADIOCTIVITY.

During photosynthesis the ‘O’ released was discovered comes from water. e) Dating rocks/fossils:\nThe quantity of 14C in living things (plants/animals) is constant. When they die the fixed mass of 14C is trapped in the cells and continues to decay/disintegrate. The half-life period of 14C is 5600 years . Comparing the mass of 14C in living and dead cells, the age of the dead can be determined. F: DANGERS OF RADIOCTIVITY. All rays emitted by radioactive isotopes have ionizing effect of changing the genetic make up of living cells. Exposure to theses radiations causes chromosomal and /or genetic mutation in living cells. Living things should therefore not be exposed for a long time to radioactive substances. One of the main uses of radioactive isotopes is in generation of large cheap electricity in nuclear reactors. Those who work in these reactors must wear protective devises made of thick glass or lead sheet. Accidental leakages of radiations usually occur\nIn 1986 the Nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in Russia had a major explosion that emitted poisonous nuclear material that caused immediate environmental disaster\nIn 2011, an earthquake in Japan caused a nuclear reactor to leak and release poisonous radioactive waste into the Indian Ocean."

The rate of a chemical reaction is also the time taken for a given mass/amount of reactant to be consumed /used up. Some reactions are too slow to be determined. e.g rusting ,decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and weathering. Some reactions are too fast and instantaneous e.g. neutralization of acid and bases/alkalis in aqueous solution and double decomposition/precipitation. Other reactions are explosive and very risky to carry out safely e.g. reaction of potassium with water and sodium with dilute acids. The study of the rate of chemical reaction is useful in knowing the factors that influence the reaction so that efficiency and profitability is maximized in industries."
"Other reactions are explosive and very risky to carry out safely e.g. reaction of potassium with water and sodium with dilute acids. The study of the rate of chemical reaction is useful in knowing the factors that influence the reaction so that efficiency and profitability is maximized in industries. Theories of rates of reaction. The rate of a chemical reaction is defined as the rate of change of concentration/amount of reactants in unit time. It is also the rate of formation of given concentration of products in unit time. i.e. Rate of reaction = Change in concentration/amount of reactants\nTime taken for the change to occur\nRate of reaction = Change in concentration/amount of products formed\nTime taken for the products to form\nFor the above, therefore the rate of a chemical reaction is rate of decreasing reactants to form an increasing product. The SI unit of time is second(s) but minutes and hours are also used. (a)The collision theory\nThe collision theory is an application of the Kinetic Theory of matter which assumes matter is made up of small/tiny/minute particles like ions atoms and molecules. The collision theory proposes that\n(i)for a reaction to occur, reacting particles must collide. (ii)not all collisions between reacting particles are successful in a reaction. Collisions that initiate a chemical reaction are called successful / fruitful/ effective collisions\n(iii)the speed at which particles collide is called collision frequency. The higher the collision frequency the higher the chances of successful / fruitful/ effective collisions to form products. (iv)the higher the chances of successful collisions, the faster the reaction. (v)the average distance between solid particles from one another is too big for them to meet and collide successfully. (vi)dissolving substances in a solvent ,make the solvent a medium for the reaction to take place. The solute particle distance is reduced as the particle ions are free to move in the solvent medium. (vii)successful collisions take place if the particles colliding have the required energy and right orientation which increases their vibration and intensity of successful / fruitful/ effective collisions to form products. (b)The Activation Energy(Ea) theory\nThe Enthalpy of activation(∆Ha) /Activation Energy(Ea) is the minimum amount of energy which the reactants must overcome before they react. Activation Energy(Ea) is usually required /needed in bond breaking of the reacting particles. Bond breaking is an endothermic process that require an energy input. The higher the bond energy the slower the reaction to start of."
"Activation Energy(Ea) is usually required /needed in bond breaking of the reacting particles. Bond breaking is an endothermic process that require an energy input. The higher the bond energy the slower the reaction to start of. Activation energy does not influence whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. The energy level diagrams below shows the activation energy for exothermic and endothermic processes/reactions. Energy level diagram showing the activation energy for exothermic processes /reactions. Activated complex\nEnergy level diagram showing the activation energy for endothermic processes /reactions. Activated complex\nThe activated complex is a mixture of many intermediate possible products which may not exist under normal physical conditions ,but can theoretically exist. Exothermic reaction proceeds without further heating /external energy because it generates its own energy/heat to overcome activation energy. Endothermic reaction cannot proceed without further heating /external energy because it does not generates its own energy/heat to overcome activation energy. It generally therefore requires continuous supply of more energy/heat to sustain it to completion. 3. Measuring the rate of a chemical reaction. The rate of a chemical reaction can be measure as:\n(i)Volume of a gas in unit time;\n- if reaction is producing a gas as one of the products. - if reaction is using a gas as one reactants\n(ii)Change in mass of reactants/products for solid products/reactants in unit time. (iii)formation of a given mass of precipitate in unit time\n(iv)a certain mass of reactants to completely form products/diminish. Reactants may be homogenous or heterogenous. -Homogenous reactions involve reactants in the same phase/state e.g. solid-solid,gas-gas,liquid-liquid. -Heterogenous reactions involve reactants in the different phase/state e.g. solid-liquid,gas-liquid,solid-gas. 4. Factors influencing/altering/affecting/determining rate of reaction\nThe following factors alter/influence/affect/determine the rate of a chemical reaction:\n(a)Concentration\n(b)Pressure\n(c) Temperature\n(d)Surface area\n(e)Catalyst\nInfluence of concentration on rate of reaction\nThe higher the concentration, the higher the rate of a chemical reaction. An increase in concentration of the reactants reduces the distance between the reacting particles increasing their collision frequency to form products. Practically an increase in concentration reduces the time taken for the reaction to take place."

"cork tightly. Add the acid into the flask. Connect the delivery tube into the gas jar.

Sample results: Table II\nSample practice questions\n1.Plot a graph of volume of gas produced (y-axis) against time\n2.Explain the shape of the graph. The rate of reaction is faster when the concentration of the acid is high . As time goes on, the concentration of the acid decreases and therefore less gas is produced.

An increase in concentration shift the rate of reaction graph to the left as less time is taken for completion of the reaction. Both graphs flatten after some time indicating the completion of the reaction. b)Influence of pressure on rate of reaction\nPressure affects only gaseous reactants.

"An increase in pressure reduces the volume(Boyles law) in which the particles are contained. Decrease in volume of the container bring the reacting particles closer to each other which increases their chances of effective/successful/fruitful collision to form products. An increase in pressure therefore increases the rate of reaction by reducing the time for reacting particles of gases to react. At industrial level, the following are some reactions that are affected by pressure:\n(a)Haber process for manufacture of ammonia\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) -> 2NH3(g)\n(b)Contact process for manufacture of sulphuric(VI)acid\n2SO2(g) + O2(g) -> 2SO3(g)\n(c)Ostwalds process for the manufacture of nitric(V)acid\n4NH3(g) + 5O2(g) -> 4NO (g) + 6H2O (l)\nThe influence of pressure on reaction rate is not felt in solids and liquids. This is because the solid and liquid particles have fixed positions in their strong bonds and therefore no degree of freedom (Kinetic Theory of matter)\nc)Influence of temperature on rate of reaction\nAn increase in temperature increases the kinetic energy of the reacting particles by increasing their collision frequency. Increase in temperature increases the particles which can overcome the activation energy (Ea). A 10oC rise in temperature doubles the rate of reaction by reducing the time taken for the reaction to complete by a half.

"d)Influence of surface area on rate of reaction\nSurface area is the area of contact. An increase in surface area is a decrease in particle size. Practically an increase in surface area involves chopping /cutting solid lumps into smaller pieces/chips then crushing the chips into powder. Chips thus have a higher surface area than solid lumps but powder has a highest surface area. An increase in surface area of solids increases the area of contact with a liquid solution increasing the chances of successful/effective/fruitful collision to form products. The influence of surface area on rate of reaction is mainly in heterogeneous reactions.

This is a chemical change that produces a new substance. On adding drops of water to an anhydrous white copper(II)sulphate(VI) the hydrated compound is formed back. The change from hydrated to anhydrous and back is therefore reversible chemical change.Both anhydrous white copper(II)sulphate(VI) and blue cobalt(II)chloride hexahydrate are therefore used to test for the presence of water when they turn to blue and pink respectively.

Bring it near the mouth of a bottle containing concentrated ammonia solution. Explain the observations made. When a glass rod containing hydrogen chloride gas is placed near ammonia gas, they react to form ammonium chloride solid that appear as white fumes. This experiment is used interchangeably to test for the presence of hydrogen chloride gas (and hence Cl- ions) and ammonia gas (and hence NH4+ ions)\n(ii)Put 2.0 g of ammonium chloride in a long dry boiling tube. Place wet / moist /damp blue and red litmus papers separately on the sides of the mouth of the boiling tube. Heat the boiling tube gently then strongly. Explain the observations made. When ammonium chloride is heated it dissociates into ammonia and hydrogen chloride gases. Since ammonia is less dense, it diffuses faster to turn both litmus papers blue before hydrogen chloride turn red because it is denser. The heating and cooling of ammonium chloride is therefore a reversible chemical change."

This is called equilibrium. Sketch showing the changes in concentration of reactants and products in a closed system\nFor a system in equilibrium:\n(i) a reaction from left to right (reactants to products) is called forward reaction. (ii) a reaction from right to left (products to reactants) is called backward reaction. (iii)a reaction in which the rate of forward reaction is equal to the rate of backward reaction is called a dynamic equilibrium. A dynamic equilibrium is therefore a balance of the rate of formation of products and reactants. This balance continues until the reactants or products are disturbed/changed/ altered. The influence of different factors on a dynamic equilibrium was first investigated from 1850-1936 by the French Chemist Louis Henry Le Chatellier. His findings were called Le Chatelliers Principle which states that:\n“if a stress/change is applied to a system in dynamic equilibrium, the system readjust/shift/move/behave so as to remove/ reduce/ counteract/ oppose the stress/change”\nLe Chatelliers Principle is applied in determining the effect/influence of several factors on systems in dynamic equilibrium. The following are the main factors that influence /alter/ affect systems in dynamic equilibrium:\n(a)Concentration\n(b)Pressure\n(c)Temperature\n(d)Catalyst\n(a)Influence of concentration on dynamic equilibrium\nAn increase/decrease in concentration of reactants/products at equilibrium is a stress. From Le Chatelliers principle the system redjust so as to remove/add the excessreduced concentration. Examples of influence of concentration on dynamic equilibrium\n(i)Chromate(VI)/CrO42- ions in solution are yellow."

Note that the solution mixture is orange. Add three drops of 2M sulphuric(VI) acid. Shake the mixture carefully. Note that the solution mixture is remains orange. Add about six drops of 2M sodium hydroxide solution. Shake carefully. Note that the solution mixture is turns yellow. Explanation\nThe above observations can be explained from the fact that both the dichromate(VI)and chromate(VI) exist in equilibrium. Dichromate(VI) ions are stable in acidic solutions while chromate(VI)ions are stable in basic solutions. An equilibrium exist thus:\nOH-\nH+\nWhen an acid is added, the equilibrium shift forward to the right and the mixture become more orange as more Cr2O72- ions exist.

Explanation\nWhen added distilled water,an equilibrium exist between bromine liquid (Br2(aq)) and the bromide ion(Br-), hydrobromite ion(OBr-) and hydrogen ion(H+) as in the equation:\nH2O(l) + Br2(aq) OBr- (aq) + H+ (aq) + Br- (aq)\nIf an acid (H+)ions is added to the equilibrium mixture, it increases the concentration of the ions on the product side which shift backwards to the left to remove the excess H+ ions on the product side making the colour of the solution mixture more yellow. If a base/alkali OH- is added to the equilibrium mixture, it reacts with H+ ions on the product side to form water.

Increase in pressure shift/favours the equilibrium towards the side with less volume/molecules. Decrease in pressure shift the equilibrium towards the side with more volume/molecules. More yield of products is obtained if high pressures produce less molecules / volume of products are formed. If the products and reactants have equal volume/molecules then pressure has no effect on the position of equilibrium\nThe following examples show the influence of pressure on dynamic equilibrium:\n(i)Nitrogen(IV)oxide /Dinitrogen tetroxide mixture\nNitrogen(IV)oxide and dinitrogen tetraoxide can exist in dynamic equilibrium in a closed test tube.

Increase in pressure of the Nitrogen/Hydrogen mixture favours the formation of more molecules of Ammonia gas in Haber process. The yield of ammonia is thus favoured by high pressures\nChemical equation : N2(g) + 3H2 (g) -> 2NH3 (g)\nGay Lussacs law 1Volume 3Volume 2Volume\nAvogadros law 1molecule 3molecule 2molecule\n(1 + 3) 4 volumes/molecules of Nitrogen and Hydrogen react to form 2 volumes/molecules of ammonia.

(c)Influence of Temperature on dynamic equilibrium\nA decrease in temperature favours the reaction that liberate/generate more heat thus exothermic reaction(-ΔH). An increase in temperature favours the reaction that do not liberate /generate more heat thus endothermic reaction(+ΔH). Endothermic reaction are thus favoured by high temperature/heating\nExothermic reaction are favoured by low temperature/cooling. If a reaction/equilibrium mixture is neither exothermic or endothermic, then a change in temperature/cooling/heating has no effect on the equilibrium position.

Dinitrogen tetraoxide is a yellow gas. Chemical equation : 2NO2(g) ===== N2 O4 (g)\nOn heating /increasing temperature, the mixture becomes more brown. On cooling the mixture become more yellow. This show that\n(i)the forward reaction to the right is exothermic(-ΔH). On heating an exothermic process the equilibrium shifts to the side that generate /liberate less heat. (ii)the backward reaction to the right is endothermic(+ΔH). On cooling an endothermic process the equilibrium shifts to the side that do not generate /liberate heat. (c)Influence of Catalyst on dynamic equilibrium\nA catalyst has no effect on the position of equilibrium.

There are many/various forms of energy like heat, electric, mechanical, and/ or chemical energy.There are two types of energy:\n(i)Kinetic Energy(KE) ;the energy in motion. (ii)Potential Energy(PE); the stored/internal energy. Energy like matter , is neither created nor destroyed but can be transformed /changed from one form to the other/ is interconvertible. This is the principle of conservation of energy. e.g. Electrical energy into heat through a filament in bulb. Chemical and physical processes take place with absorption or evolution/production of energy mainly in form of heat\nThe study of energy changes that accompany physical/chemical reaction/changes is called Thermochemistry. Physical/chemical reaction/changes that involve energy changes are called thermochemical reactions. The SI unit of energy is the Joule(J).Kilo Joules(kJ)and megaJoules(MJ) are also used.

"∆Hᶿf is practically difficult to determine in a school laboratory. It is determined normally determined by applying Hess’ law of constant heat summation. Hess’ law of constant heat summation states that “the total enthalpy/heat/energy change of a reaction is the same regardless of the route taken from reactants to products at the same temperature and pressure”. Hess’ law of constant heat summation is as a result of a series of experiments done by the German Scientist Henri Hess(1802-1850). He found that the total energy change from the reactants to products was the same irrespective of the intermediate products between. i.e. A(s) --∆H1-->C(s) = A(s) --∆H2-->B(s)--∆H3-->C(s)\nApplying Hess’ law of constant heat summation then:\nA(s) ∆H2B(s)\n∆H1 ∆H3\nC(s)\nThe above is called an energy cycle diagram. It can be used to calculate any of the missing energy changes since:\n(i) ∆H1 =∆H2 + ∆H3\n(ii) ∆H2 =∆H1 + -∆H3\n(iii) ∆H3 = - ∆H1 + ∆H2\nExamples of applying Hess’ law of constant heat summation\n1.Calculate the molar enthalpy of formation of methane (CH4) given that ∆Hᶿc of carbon-graphite is -393.5kJmole-1,Hydrogen is -285.7 kJmole-1 and that of methane is 890 kJmole-1\nWorking\nCarbon-graphite ,hydrogen and oxygen can react to first form methane. Methane will then burn in the oxygen present to form carbon(IV)oxide and water. Carbon-graphite can burn in the oxygen to form carbon(IV)oxide. Hydrogen can burn in the oxygen to form water."
