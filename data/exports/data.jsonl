"ATOMIC STRUCTURE AND THE PERIODIC TABLE Preface The structure of the atom is extensively covered here. The periodic table is the arrangement of atoms of elements based on their atomic structure. Emphasis on the trends across and down the periodic table of atoms is important for the teacher facilitator. This work should be covered before “Chemical bonding and structure”. The two complements each other in understanding periodicity.

Isotopes are atoms of the same element, having the same number of protons/atomic number but different number of neutrons/mass number. By convention, isotopes are written with the mass number as superscript and the atomic number as subscript to the left of the chemical symbol of the element. i.e."

The atom recommended is 12C isotope whose mass is arbitrarily assigned as 12.000 atomic mass units(a.m.u) . All other atoms are compared to the mass of 12C isotope to give the relative at The relative atomic mass(RAM) is therefore defined as “the mass of average atom of an element compared to 1/12 an atom of 12C isotope whose mass is arbitrarily fixed as 12.000 atomic mass units(a.m.u) ” i.e; RAM = mass of atom of an element 1/12 of one atom of 12C isotope Accurate relative atomic masses (RAM) are got from the mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometer determines the isotopes of the element and their relative abundance/availability. Using the relative abundances/availability of the isotopes, the relative atomic mass (RAM) can be determined /calculated as in the below examples."

Mass spectrometer determines the isotopes of the element and their relative abundance/availability. Using the relative abundances/availability of the isotopes, the relative atomic mass (RAM) can be determined /calculated as in the below examples. a) Chlorine occurs as 75% 3517Cl and 25% 3717Cl isotopes. Calculate the relative atomic mass of Chlorine. Working 100 atoms of chlorine contains 75 atoms of 3517Cl isotopes 100 atoms of chlorine contains 75 atoms of 3717Cl isotopes Therefore; RAM of chlorine = ( 75/100 x 35) + 25/100 x 37 = 35.5 Note that: Relative atomic mass has no units More atoms of chlorine exist as 3517Cl(75%) than as 3717Cl(25%) therefore RAM is nearer to the more abundant isotope. b) Calculate the relative atomic mass of potassium given that it exist as;\n5 93.1% 3919K , 0.01% 4019K , 6.89% 4119K , Working 100 atoms of potassium contains 93.1 atoms of 3919K isotopes 100 atoms of potassium contains 0.01 atoms of 4019K isotopes 100 atoms of potassium contains 6.89 atoms of 4119K isotopes Therefore; RAM of potassium = (93.1/100 x39) + (0.01/100 x 40) +(6.89 /100 x 39) = Note that: Relative atomic mass has no units More atoms of potassium exist as 3919K (93.1%) therefore RAM is nearer to the more abundant 3919K isotope."

The higher the relative atomic mass, the heavier the atom. Electrons are found in energy levels/orbital. An energy level is a fixed region around/surrounding the nucleus of an atom occupied by electrons of the same (potential) energy. By convention energy levels are named 1,2,3… outwards from the region nearest to nucleus."

"Scientists have tried to group them together in a periodic table. A periodic table is a horizontal and vertical arrangement of elements according to their atomic numbers. This table was successfully arranged in 1913 by the British scientist Henry Moseley from the previous work of the Russian Scientist Dmitri Mendeleev. The horizontal arrangement forms period. Atoms in the same period have the same the same number of energy levels in their electronic structure. i.e. The number of energy levels in the electronic configuration of an element determine the period to which the element is in the periodic table. e.g. Which period of the periodic table are the following isotopes/elements/atoms? a) 126C Electron structure 2:4 => 2 energy levels used thus Period 2 b) 2311Na Electron structure 2:8:1 => 3 energy levels used thus Period 3 c) 3919K Electron structure 2:8:8:1 => 4 energy levels used thus Period 4 d) 11H Electron structure 1: => 1 energy level used thus Period 1 The vertical arrangement of elements forms a group. Atoms in the same have the same the same group have the same number of outer energy level electrons as per their electronic structure. i.e. The number of electrons in the outer energy level an element determine the group to which the element is ,in the periodic table. 13 a) 126C Electron structure 2:4 => 4 electrons in outer energy level thus Group IV b) 2311C Electron structure 2:8:1 => 1 electron in outer energy level thus Group I c) 3919K Electron structure 2:8:8:1=>1 electron in outer energy level thus Group I d) 11H Electron structure 1: => 1 electron in outer energy level thus Group I By convention; (i)Periods are named using English numerals 1,2,3,4,… (ii)Groups are named using Roman numerals I,II,III,IV,… There are eighteen groups in a standard periodic table. There are seven periods in a standard periodic table. When an atom has maximum number of electrons in its outer energy level, it is said to be stable. When an atom has no maximum number of electrons in its outer energy level, it is said to be unstable. All stable atoms are in group 8/18 of the periodic table. All other elements are unstable."
"When an atom has no maximum number of electrons in its outer energy level, it is said to be unstable. All stable atoms are in group 8/18 of the periodic table. All other elements are unstable. THE STANDARD PERIODIC TABLE OF ELEMENTS\n14 All unstable atoms/isotopes try to be stable through chemical reactions. A chemical reaction involves gaining or losing outer electrons (electron transfer) .When electron transfer take place, an ion is formed. An ion is formed when an unstable atom gain or donate electrons in its outer energy level inorder to be stable. Whether an atom gain or donate electrons depend on the relative energy required to donate or gain extra electrons i.e. Examples 1. 199 F has electronic structure/configuration 2:7. It can donate the seven outer electrons to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:. It can gain one extra electron to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:8. Gaining requires less energy, and thus Fluorine reacts by gaining one extra electrons. 2. 2313 Al has electronic structure/configuration 2:8:3 It can donate the three outer electrons to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:8. It can gain five extra electrons to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:8:8. Donating requires less energy, and thus Aluminium reacts by donating its three outer electrons. Elements with less than four electrons in the outer energy level donates /lose the outer electrons to be stable and form a positively charged ion called cation. A cation therefore has more protons(positive charge) than electrons(negative charge) Generally metals usually form cation Elements with more than four electrons in the outer energy level gain /acquire extra electrons in the outer energy level to be stable and form a negatively charged ion called anion. An anion therefore has less protons(positive charge) than electrons(negative charge) Generally non metals usually form anion. Except Hydrogen The charge carried by an ion is equal to the number of electrons gained/acquired or donated/lost. Examples of ion formation 1.11H H -> H+ + e (atom) (monovalent cation) (electrons donated/lost) Electronic configuration 1: (No electrons remains)\n15 2. 2713 Al Al -> Al3+ + 3e (atom) (trivalent cation) (3 electrons donated/lost) Electron 2:8:3 2:8 structure (unstable) (stable) 3."

The number of valence electrons and the number of occupied energy levels in an atom of an element determine the position of an element in the periodic table.i.e The number of occupied energy levels determine the Period and the valence electrons determine the Group. Elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties. The trends in physical and chemical properties of elements in the same group vary down the group. Elements in the same group thus constitute a chemical family. (a) Group I elements: Alkali metals Group I elements are called Alkali metals except Hydrogen which is a non metal. The alkali metals include: Element Symbol Atomic number Electron structure Oxidation state Valency Lithium Li 3 2:1 Li+ 1 Sodium Na 11 2:8:1 Na+ 1 Potassium K 19 2:8:8:1 K+ 1 Rubidium Rb 37 2:8:18:8:1 Rb+ 1 Caesium Cs 55 2:8:18:18:8:1 Cs+ 1 Francium Fr 87 2:8:18:32:18:8:1 Fr+ 1 All alkali metals atom has one electron in the outer energy level."

They therefore are monovalent. They donate /lose the outer electron to have oxidation state M+ The number of energy levels increases down the group from Lithium to Francium. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size of Potassium is bigger/larger than that of sodium because Potassium has more/4 energy levels than sodium (3 energy levels). Atomic and ionic radius The distance between the centre of the nucleus of an atom and the outermost energy level occupied by electron/s is called atomic radius. Atomic radius is measured in nanometers(n).The higher /bigger the atomic radius the bigger /larger the atomic size. The distance between the centre of the nucleus of an ion and the outermost energy level occupied by electron/s is called ionic radius. Ionic radius is also\n28 measured in nanometers(n).The higher /bigger the ionic radius the bigger /larger the size of the ion. Atomic radius and ionic radius depend on the number of energy levels occupied by electrons. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic /ionic radius. e.g. The atomic radius of Francium is bigger/larger than that of sodium because Francium has more/7 energy levels than sodium (3 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkali metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkali metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because alkali metals react by losing/donating the outer electron and hence lose the outer energy level."
"Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkali metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkali metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because alkali metals react by losing/donating the outer electron and hence lose the outer energy level. Table showing the atomic and ionic radius of some alkali metals Element Symbol Atomic number Atomic radius(nM) Ionic radius(nM) Lithium Li 3 0.133 0.060 Sodium Na 11 0.157 0.095 Potassium K 19 0.203 0.133 The atomic radius of sodium is 0.157nM .The ionic radius of Na+ is 0.095nM. This is because sodium reacts by donating/losing the outer electrons and hence the outer energy level. The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. Electropositivity The ease of donating/losing electrons is called electropositivity. All alkali metals are electropositive. Electropositivity increase as atomic radius increase. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The outer electrons experience less nuclear attraction and can be lost/ donated easily/with ease. Francium is the most electropositive element in the periodic table because it has the highest/biggest atomic radius. Ionization energy The minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom of element in its gaseous state is called 1st ionization energy. The SI unit of ionization energy is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 .Ionization energy depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer electrons/energy level and thus the lower the ionization energy. For alkali metals the 1st ionization energy decrease down the group as\n29 the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. e.g. The 1st ionization energy of sodium is 496 kJmole-1 while that of potassium is 419 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from sodium to Potassium. It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electrons in Potassium than in sodium."

It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electrons in Potassium than in sodium. Physical properties Soft/Easy to cut: Alkali metals are soft and easy to cut with a knife. The softness and ease of cutting increase down the group from Lithium to Francium. This is because an increase in atomic radius, decreases the strength of metallic bond and the packing of the metallic structure Appearance: Alkali metals have a shiny grey metallic luster when freshly cut. The surface rapidly/quickly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface rapidly/quickly reacts with elements of air/oxygen. Melting and boiling points: Alkali metals have a relatively low melting/boiling point than common metals like Iron. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weak metallic bond/structure. Electrical/thermal conductivity: Alkali metals are good thermal and electrical conductors. Metals conduct using the outer mobile delocalized electrons. The delocalized electrons move randomly within the metallic structure.

They therefore float in water.They react with water to form a strongly alkaline solution of their hydroxides and producing hydrogen gas. The rate of this reaction increase down the group. i.e. Potassium is more reactive than sodium .Sodium is more reactive than Lithium. The reactivity increases as electropositivity increases of the alkali increases. This is because as the atomic radius increases , the ease of donating/losing outer electron increase during chemical reactions."

"The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. Electropositivity All alkaline earth metals are also electropositive like alkali metals. The electropositivity increase with increase in atomic radius/size. Calcium is more electropositive than Magnesium. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The two outer electrons in calcium experience less nuclear attraction and can be lost/ donated easily/with ease because of the higher/bigger atomic radius. Ionization energy For alkaline earth metals the 1st ionization energy decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. e.g. The 1st ionization energy of Magnesium is 900 kJmole-1 while that of Calcium is 590 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from magnesium to calcium. It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electron in calcium than in magnesium. The minimum amount of energy required to remove a second electron from an ion of an element in its gaseous state is called the 2nd ionization energy. The 2nd ionization energy is always higher /bigger than the 1st ionization energy. This because once an electron is donated /lost form an atom, the overall effective nuclear attraction on the remaining electrons/energy level increase. Removing a second electron from the ion require therefore more energy than the first electron. The atomic radius of alkali metals is higher/bigger than that of alkaline earth metals.This is because across/along the period from left to right there is an increase in nuclear charge from additional number of protons and still additional number of electrons entering the same energy level. Increase in nuclear charge increases the effective nuclear attraction on the outer energy level which pulls it closer to the nucleus. e.g. Atomic radius of Sodium (0.157nM) is higher than that of Magnesium (0.137nM). This is because Magnesium has more effective nuclear attraction on\n35 the outer energy level than Sodium hence pulls outer energy level more nearer to its nucleus. Physical properties Soft/Easy to cut: Alkaline earth metals are not soft and easy to cut with a knife like alkali metals."
"Atomic radius of Sodium (0.157nM) is higher than that of Magnesium (0.137nM). This is because Magnesium has more effective nuclear attraction on\n35 the outer energy level than Sodium hence pulls outer energy level more nearer to its nucleus. Physical properties Soft/Easy to cut: Alkaline earth metals are not soft and easy to cut with a knife like alkali metals. This is because of the decrease in atomic radius of corresponding alkaline earth metal, increases the strength of metallic bond and the packing of the metallic structure. Alkaline earth metals are (i)ductile(able to form wire/thin long rods) (ii)malleable(able to be hammered into sheet/long thin plates) (iii)have high tensile strength(able to be coiled without breaking/ not brittle/withstand stress) Appearance: Alkali earth metals have a shiny grey metallic luster when their surface is freshly polished /scrubbed. The surface slowly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface slowly undergoes oxidation to form an oxide. This oxide layer should be removed before using the alkaline earth metals. Melting and boiling points: Alkaline earth metals have a relatively high melting/ boiling point than alkali metals. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weaker metallic bond/structure. Alkaline earth metals use two delocalized electrons to form a stronger metallic bond /structure. The melting and boiling points decrease down the group as the atomic radius/size increase reducing the strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure. e.g. Beryllium has a melting point of 1280oC. Magnesium has a melting point of 650oC.Beryllium has a smaller atomic radius/size than magnesium .The strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure is thus stronger in beryllium. Electrical/thermal conductivity: Alkaline earth metals are good thermal and electrical conductors. The two delocalized valence electrons move randomly within the metallic structure. Electrical conductivity increase down the group as the atomic radius/size increase making the delocalized outer electrons less attracted to nucleus. Alkaline earth metals are better thermal and electrical conductors than alkali metals because they have more/two outer delocalized electrons.e.g. Magnesium is a better conductor than sodium because it has more/two delocalized electrons than sodium."

(c)Group VII elements: Halogens Group VII elements are called Halogens. They are all non metals.

They acquire/gain one electron in the outer energy level to be stable. They therefore are therefore monovalent .They exist in oxidation state X- The number of energy levels increases down the group from Fluorine to Astatine. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g."
"They therefore are therefore monovalent .They exist in oxidation state X- The number of energy levels increases down the group from Fluorine to Astatine. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Chlorine is bigger/larger than that of Fluorine because Chlorine has more/3 energy levels than Fluorine (2 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of Halogens increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of Halogens is smaller than the ionic radius. This is because they react by gaining/acquiring extra one electron in the outer energy level. The effective nuclear attraction on the more/extra electrons decreases. The incoming extra electron is also repelled causing the outer energy level to expand to reduce the repulsion and accommodate more electrons. Table showing the atomic and ionic radius of four Halogens\n42 Element Symbol Atomic number Atomic radius(nM) Ionic radius(nM) Fluorine F 9 0.064 0.136 Chlorine Cl 17 0.099 0.181 Bromine Br 35 0.114 0.195 Iodine I 53 0.133 0.216 The atomic radius of Chlorine is 0.099nM .The ionic radius of Cl- is 0.181nM. This is because Chlorine atom/molecule reacts by gaining/acquiring extra one electrons. The more/extra electrons/energy level experience less effective nuclear attraction /pull towards the nucleus .The outer enegy level expand/increase to reduce the repulsion of the existing and incoming gained /acquired electrons. Electronegativity The ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons is called electronegativity. All halogens are electronegative. Electronegativity decreases as atomic radius increase. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The outer electrons experience less nuclear attraction and thus ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons decrease. It is measured using Pauling’s scale. Where Fluorine with Pauling scale 4.0 is the most electronegative element and thus the highest tendency to acquire/gain extra electron. Table showing the electronegativity of the halogens."
"It is measured using Pauling’s scale. Where Fluorine with Pauling scale 4.0 is the most electronegative element and thus the highest tendency to acquire/gain extra electron. Table showing the electronegativity of the halogens. Halogen F Cl Br I At Electronegativity (Pauling scale) 4.0 3.0 2.8 2.5 2.2 The electronegativity of the halogens decrease down the group from fluorine to Astatine. This is because atomic radius increases down the group and thus decrease electron – attracting power down the group from fluorine to astatine. Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table because it has the small atomic radius. Electron affinity The minimum amount of energy required to gain/acquire an extra electron by an atom of element in its gaseous state is called 1st electron affinity. The SI unit of electron affinity is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 . Electron affinity depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons and thus the lower the electron affinity. For halogens the 1st electron affinity decrease down the group as the\n43 atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. Due to its small size/atomic radius Fluorine shows exceptionally low electron affinity. This is because a lot of energy is required to overcome the high repulsion of the existing and incoming electrons. Table showing the election affinity of halogens for the process X + e -> X- The higher the electron affinity the more stable theion.i.e Cl- is a more stable ion than Br- because it has a more negative / exothermic electron affinity than Br- Electron affinity is different from: (i) Ionization energy. Ionization energy is the energy required to lose/donate an electron in an atom of an element in its gaseous state while electron affinity is the energy required to gain/acquire extra electron by an atom of an element in its gaseous state. (ii) Electronegativity. -Electron affinity is the energy required to gain an electron in an atom of an element in gaseous state. It involves the process: X(g) + e -> X-(g) Electronegativity is the ease/tendency of gaining/ acquiring electrons by an element during chemical reactions."
"(ii) Electronegativity. -Electron affinity is the energy required to gain an electron in an atom of an element in gaseous state. It involves the process: X(g) + e -> X-(g) Electronegativity is the ease/tendency of gaining/ acquiring electrons by an element during chemical reactions. It does not involve use of energy but theoretical arbitrary Pauling’ scale of measurements. Physical properties State at room temperature Fluorine and Chlorine are gases, Bromine is a liquid and Iodine is a solid. Astatine is radioactive . All halogens exist as diatomic molecules bonded by strong covalent bond. Each molecule is joined to the other by weak intermolecular forces/ Van-der-waals forces. Melting/Boiling point The strength of intermolecular/Van-der-waals forces of attraction increase with increase in molecular size/atomic radius. Iodine has therefore the largest atomic radius and thus strongest intermolecular forces to make it a solid. Iodine sublimes when heated to form (caution: highly toxic/poisonous) purple vapour. Halogen F Cl Br I Electron affinity kJmole-1 -333 -364 -342 -295\n44 This is because Iodine molecules are held together by weak van-derwaals/intermolecular forces which require little heat energy to break. Electrical conductivity All Halogens are poor conductors of electricity because they have no free delocalized electrons. Solubility in polar and non-polar solvents All halogens are soluble in water(polar solvent). When a boiling tube containing either chlorine gas or bromine vapour is separately inverted in a beaker containing distilled water and tetrachloromethane (non-polar solvent), the level of solution in boiling tube rises in both water and tetrachloromethane. This is because halogen are soluble in both polar and non-polar solvents. Solubility of halogens in water/polar solvents decrease down the group. Solubility of halogens in non-polar solvent increase down the group. The level of water in chlorine is higher than in bromine and the level of tetrachloromethane in chlorine is lower than in bromine. Caution: Tetrachloromethane , Bromine vapour and Chlorine gas are all highly toxic/poisonous."

Using Bromine water Yellow colour of bromine water fades in test tubes containing sodium iodide. -Coloured Solution formed. Explanation The halogens displace each other from their solution. The more electronegative displace the less electronegative from their solution. Chlorine is more electronegative than bromine and iodine. On adding chlorine water, bromine and Iodine are displaced from their solutions by chlorine. Bromine is more electronegative than iodide but less 6than chlorine. On adding Bromine water, iodine is displaced from its solution but not chlorine."

Explain the trend in bond Energy of the halogens above: -Decrease down the group from chlorine to Iodine -Atomic radius increase down the group decreasing the energy required to break the covalent bonds between the larger atom with reduced effective nuclear @ charge an outer energy level that take part in bonding. (c)Group VIII elements: Noble gases Group VIII elements are called Noble gases. They are all non metals. Noble gases occupy about 1.0% of the atmosphere as colourless gaseous mixture. Argon is the most abundant with 0.9%. They exists as monatomic molecules with very weak van-der-waals /intermolecular forces holding the molecules. They include: All noble gas atoms have a stable duplet(two electrons in the 1st energy level) or octet(eight electrons in other outer energy level)in the outer energy level. They therefore do not acquire/gain extra electron in the outer energy level or donate/lose. They therefore are therefore zerovalent . The number of energy levels increases down the group from Helium to Randon."
"They therefore do not acquire/gain extra electron in the outer energy level or donate/lose. They therefore are therefore zerovalent . The number of energy levels increases down the group from Helium to Randon. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size/radius. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Argon is bigger/larger than that of Neon because Argon has more/3 energy levels than Neon (2 energy levels). Atomic radius noble gases increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The effective nuclear attraction on the outer electrons thus decrease down the group. The noble gases are generally unreactive because the outer energy level has the stable octet/duplet. The stable octet/duplet in noble gas atoms lead to a Element Symbol Atomic number Electron structure State at room temperature Helium He 2 2: Colourless gas Neon Ne 10 2:8 Colourless gas Argon Ar 18 2:8:8 Colourless gas Krypton Kr 36 2:8:18:8 Colourless gas Xenon Xe 54 2:8:18:18:8 Colourless gas Radon Rn 86 2:8:18:32:18:8 Radioctive\n48 comparatively very high 1st ionization energy. This is because losing /donating an electron from the stable atom require a lot of energy to lose/donate and make it unstable. As atomic radius increase down the group and the 1st ionization energy decrease, very electronegative elements like Oxygen and Fluorine are able to react and bond with lower members of the noble gases.e.g Xenon reacts with Fluorine to form a covalent compound XeF6.This is because the outer electrons/energy level if Xenon is far from the nucleus and thus experience less effective nuclear attraction. Noble gases have low melting and boiling points. This is because they exist as monatomic molecules joined by very weak intermolecular/van-der-waals forces that require very little energy to weaken and form liquid and break to form a gas. The intermolecular/van-der-waals forces increase down the group as the atomic radius/size increase from Helium to Radon. The melting and boiling points thus increase also down the group. Noble gases are insoluble in water and are poor conductors of electricity."

Neon is used in street and advertisement light Helium is mixed with Oxygen during deep sea diving and mountaineering. Helium is used in weather balloon for meteorological research instead of Hydrogen because it is unreactive/inert.Hydrogen when impure can ignite with an explosion. Helium is used in making thermometers for measuring very low temperatures. 49 C. PERIODICITY OF ACROSS THE PERIOD. (See Chemical bonding and Structure)\nPERIODICITY OF CHEMICAL FAMILES (Patterns down the group) The number of valence electrons and the number of occupied energy levels in an atom of an element determine the position of an element in the periodic table. i.e The number of occupied energy levels determine the Period and the valence electrons determine the Group. Elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties. The trends in physical and chemical properties of elements in the same group vary down the group. Elements in the same group thus constitute a chemical family. (a) Group I elements: Alkali metals Group I elements are called Alkali metals except Hydrogen which is a non metal."
"The trends in physical and chemical properties of elements in the same group vary down the group. Elements in the same group thus constitute a chemical family.

They therefore are monovalent. They donate /lose the outer electron to have oxidation state M+ The number of energy levels increases down the group from Lithium to Francium. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size of Potassium is bigger/larger than that of sodium because Potassium has more/4 energy levels than sodium (3 energy levels). Atomic and ionic radius The distance between the centre of the nucleus of an atom and the outermost energy level occupied by electron/s is called atomic radius. Atomic radius is measured in nanometers(n).The higher /bigger the atomic radius the bigger /larger the atomic size. 2 The distance between the centre of the nucleus of an ion and the outermost energy level occupied by electron/s is called ionic radius. Ionic radius is also measured in nanometers(n).The higher /bigger the ionic radius the bigger /larger the size of the ion. Atomic radius and ionic radius depend on the number of energy levels occupied by electrons.

Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkali metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkali metals is bigger than the ionic radius."
"The atomic radius of Francium is bigger/larger than that of sodium because Francium has more/7 energy levels than sodium (3 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkali metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkali metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because alkali metals react by losing/donating the outer electron and hence lose the outer energy level. Table showing the atomic and ionic radius of some alkali metals Element Symbol Atomic number Atomic radius(nM) Ionic radius(nM) Lithium Li 3 0.133 0.060 Sodium Na 11 0.157 0.095 Potassium K 19 0.203 0.133 The atomic radius of sodium is 0.157nM .The ionic radius of Na+ is 0.095nM. This is because sodium reacts by donating/losing the outer electrons and hence the outer energy level. The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. Electropositivity The ease of donating/losing electrons is called electropositivity. All alkali metals are electropositive. Electropositivity increase as atomic radius increase. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The outer electrons experience less nuclear attraction and can be lost/ donated easily/with ease. Francium is the most electropositive element in the periodic table because it has the highest/biggest atomic radius. Ionization energy\n3 The minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom of element in its gaseous state is called 1st ionization energy. The SI unit of ionization energy is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 .Ionization energy depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer electrons/energy level and thus the lower the ionization energy. For alkali metals the 1st ionization energy decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. e.g. The 1st ionization energy of sodium is 496 kJmole-1 while that of potassium is 419 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from sodium to Potassium."

It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electrons in Potassium than in sodium. Physical properties Soft/Easy to cut: Alkali metals are soft and easy to cut with a knife. The softness and ease of cutting increase down the group from Lithium to Francium. This is because an increase in atomic radius, decreases the strength of metallic bond and the packing of the metallic structure Appearance: Alkali metals have a shiny grey metallic luster when freshly cut. The surface rapidly/quickly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface rapidly/quickly reacts with elements of air/oxygen. Melting and boiling points: Alkali metals have a relatively low melting/boiling point than common metals like Iron. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weak metallic bond/structure. Electrical/thermal conductivity: Alkali metals are good thermal and electrical conductors. Metals conduct using the outer mobile delocalized electrons. The delocalized electrons move randomly within the metallic structure.

The rate of this reaction increase down the group. i.e. Potassium is more reactive than sodium .Sodium is more reactive than Lithium.

"They donate /lose the two outer electrons to have oxidation state M2+ The number of energy levels increases down the group from Beryllium to Radium. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Calcium is bigger/larger than that of Magnesium because Calcium has more/4 energy levels than Magnesium (3 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkaline earth metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkaline earth metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because they react by losing/donating the two outer electrons and hence lose the outer energy level.

This is because Magnesium reacts by donating/losing the two outer electrons and hence the outer energy level. The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. 9 Electropositivity All alkaline earth metals are also electropositive like alkali metals. The electropositivity increase with increase in atomic radius/size. Calcium is more electropositive than Magnesium. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The two outer electrons in calcium experience less nuclear attraction and can be lost/ donated easily/with ease because of the higher/bigger atomic radius. Ionization energy For alkaline earth metals the 1st ionization energy decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. e.g. The 1st ionization energy of Magnesium is 900 kJmole-1 while that of Calcium is 590 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from magnesium to calcium. It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electron in calcium than in magnesium."
"e.g. The 1st ionization energy of Magnesium is 900 kJmole-1 while that of Calcium is 590 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from magnesium to calcium. It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electron in calcium than in magnesium. The minimum amount of energy required to remove a second electron from an ion of an element in its gaseous state is called the 2nd ionization energy. The 2nd ionization energy is always higher /bigger than the 1st ionization energy. This because once an electron is donated /lost form an atom, the overall effective nuclear attraction on the remaining electrons/energy level increase. Removing a second electron from the ion require therefore more energy than the first electron. The atomic radius of alkali metals is higher/bigger than that of alkaline earth metals.This is because across/along the period from left to right there is an increase in nuclear charge from additional number of protons and still additional number of electrons entering the same energy level. Increase in nuclear charge increases the effective nuclear attraction on the outer energy level which pulls it closer to the nucleus. e.g. Atomic radius of Sodium (0.157nM) is higher than that of Magnesium (0.137nM). This is because Magnesium has more effective nuclear attraction on the outer energy level than Sodium hence pulls outer energy level more nearer to its nucleus. Physical properties Soft/Easy to cut: Alkaline earth metals are not soft and easy to cut with a knife like alkali metals. This is because of the decrease in atomic radius of\n10 corresponding alkaline earth metal, increases the strength of metallic bond and the packing of the metallic structure. Alkaline earth metals are (i)ductile(able to form wire/thin long rods) (ii)malleable(able to be hammered into sheet/long thin plates) (iii)have high tensile strength(able to be coiled without breaking/ not brittle/withstand stress) Appearance: Alkali earth metals have a shiny grey metallic luster when their surface is freshly polished /scrubbed. The surface slowly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface slowly undergoes oxidation to form an oxide. This oxide layer should be removed before using the alkaline earth metals."
"The surface slowly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface slowly undergoes oxidation to form an oxide. This oxide layer should be removed before using the alkaline earth metals. Melting and boiling points: Alkaline earth metals have a relatively high melting/ boiling point than alkali metals. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weaker metallic bond/structure. Alkaline earth metals use two delocalized electrons to form a stronger metallic bond /structure. The melting and boiling points decrease down the group as the atomic radius/size increase reducing the strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure. e.g. Beryllium has a melting point of 1280oC. Magnesium has a melting point of 650oC.Beryllium has a smaller atomic radius/size than magnesium .The strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure is thus stronger in beryllium. Electrical/thermal conductivity: Alkaline earth metals are good thermal and electrical conductors. The two delocalized valence electrons move randomly within the metallic structure. Electrical conductivity increase down the group as the atomic radius/size increase making the delocalized outer electrons less attracted to nucleus. Alkaline earth metals are better thermal and electrical conductors than alkali metals because they have more/two outer delocalized electrons.e.g. Magnesium is a better conductor than sodium because it has more/two delocalized electrons than sodium. The more delocalized electrons the better the electrical conductor. Calcium is a better conductor than magnesium. Calcium has bigger/larger atomic radius than magnesium because the delocalized electrons are less attracted to the nucleus of calcium and thus more free /mobile and thus better the electrical conductor Summary of some physical properties of the 1st three alkaline earth metals\n11 Alkaline earth metal Appearance Ease of cutting Melting point (oC) Boiling point (oC) Conduct- ivity 1st ionization energy 2nd ionization energy Beryllium Shiny grey Not easy 1280 3450 Good 900 1800 Magnesium Shiny grey Not Easy 650 1110 Good 736 1450 calcium Shiny grey Not easy 850 1140 Good 590 970 Chemical properties (i)Reaction with air/oxygen On exposure to air, the surface of alkaline earth metals is slowly oxidized to its oxide on prolonged exposure to air."

The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Chlorine is bigger/larger than that of Fluorine because Chlorine has more/3 energy levels than Fluorine (2 energy levels). 17 Atomic radius and ionic radius of Halogens increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of Halogens is smaller than the ionic radius. This is because they react by gaining/acquiring extra one electron in the outer energy level. The effective nuclear attraction on the more/extra electrons decreases. The incoming extra electron is also repelled causing the outer energy level to expand to reduce the repulsion and accommodate more electrons.

Electronegativity The ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons is called electronegativity. All halogens are electronegative. Electronegativity decreases as atomic radius increase. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The outer electrons experience less nuclear attraction and thus ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons decrease. It is measured using Pauling’s scale. Where Fluorine with Pauling scale 4.0 is the most electronegative element and thus the highest tendency to acquire/gain extra electron. Table showing the electronegativity of the halogens. Halogen F Cl Br I At Electronegativity (Pauling scale) 4.0 3.0 2.8 2.5 2.2\n18 The electronegativity of the halogens decrease down the group from fluorine to Astatine. This is because atomic radius increases down the group and thus decrease electron – attracting power down the group from fluorine to astatine. Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table because it has the small atomic radius. Electron affinity The minimum amount of energy required to gain/acquire an extra electron by an atom of element in its gaseous state is called 1st electron affinity. The SI unit of electron affinity is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 . Electron affinity depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons and thus the lower the electron affinity."
"The SI unit of electron affinity is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 . Electron affinity depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons and thus the lower the electron affinity. For halogens the 1st electron affinity decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. Due to its small size/atomic radius Fluorine shows exceptionally low electron affinity. This is because a lot of energy is required to overcome the high repulsion of the existing and incoming electrons. Table showing the election affinity of halogens for the process X + e -> X- The higher the electron affinity the more stable theion.i.e Cl- is a more stable ion than Br- because it has a more negative / exothermic electron affinity than Br- Electron affinity is different from: (i) Ionization energy.

Physical properties State at room temperature Fluorine and Chlorine are gases, Bromine is a liquid and Iodine is a solid. Astatine is radioactive . All halogens exist as diatomic molecules bonded by strong covalent bond. Each molecule is joined to the other by weak intermolecular forces/ Van-der-waals forces. Melting/Boiling point The strength of intermolecular/Van-der-waals forces of attraction increase with increase in molecular size/atomic radius. Iodine has therefore the largest atomic radius and thus strongest intermolecular forces to make it a solid. Iodine sublimes when heated to form (caution: highly toxic/poisonous) purple vapour."
"Melting/Boiling point The strength of intermolecular/Van-der-waals forces of attraction increase with increase in molecular size/atomic radius. Iodine has therefore the largest atomic radius and thus strongest intermolecular forces to make it a solid. Iodine sublimes when heated to form (caution: highly toxic/poisonous) purple vapour. This is because Iodine molecules are held together by weak van-derwaals/intermolecular forces which require little heat energy to break. Electrical conductivity All Halogens are poor conductors of electricity because they have no free delocalized electrons. Solubility in polar and non-polar solvents All halogens are soluble in water(polar solvent). When a boiling tube containing either chlorine gas or bromine vapour is separately inverted in a beaker containing distilled water and tetrachloromethane (non-polar solvent), the level of solution in boiling tube rises in both water and tetrachloromethane. This is because halogen are soluble in both polar and non-polar solvents. Solubility of halogens in water/polar solvents decrease down the group. Solubility of halogens in non-polar solvent increase down the group. The level of water in chlorine is higher than in bromine and the level of tetrachloromethane in chlorine is lower than in bromine.

(c)Group VIII elements: Noble gases Group VIII elements are called Noble gases. They are all non metals. Noble gases occupy about 1.0% of the atmosphere as colourless gaseous mixture. Argon is the most abundant with 0.9%. They exists as monatomic molecules with very weak van-der-waals /intermolecular forces holding the molecules. They include: All noble gas atoms have a stable duplet(two electrons in the 1st energy level) or octet(eight electrons in other outer energy level)in the outer energy level. They therefore do not acquire/gain extra electron in the outer energy level or donate/lose. They therefore are therefore zerovalent . The number of energy levels increases down the group from Helium to Randon."
"They therefore do not acquire/gain extra electron in the outer energy level or donate/lose. They therefore are therefore zerovalent . The number of energy levels increases down the group from Helium to Randon. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size/radius. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Argon is bigger/larger than that of Neon because Argon has more/3 energy levels than Neon (2 energy levels). Atomic radius noble gases increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The effective nuclear attraction on the outer electrons thus decrease down the group. The noble gases are generally unreactive because the outer energy level has the stable octet/duplet. The stable octet/duplet in noble gas atoms lead to a comparatively very high 1st ionization energy. This is because losing /donating an electron from the stable atom require a lot of energy to lose/donate and make it unstable.

Noble gases have low melting and boiling points. This is because they exist as monatomic molecules joined by very weak intermolecular/van-der-waals forces that require very little energy to weaken and form liquid and break to form a gas. The intermolecular/van-der-waals forces increase down the group as the atomic radius/size increase from Helium to Radon. The melting and boiling points thus increase also down the group. Noble gases are insoluble in water and are poor conductors of electricity."

Neon is used in street and advertisement light Helium is mixed with Oxygen during deep sea diving and mountaineering. Helium is used in weather balloon for meteorological research instead of Hydrogen because it is unreactive/inert. Hydrogen when impure can ignite with an explosion. Helium is used in making thermometers for measuring very low temperatures. STRUCTURE AND BONDING IONIC (ELECTROVALENT) BONDING Noble gases like neon or argon have eight electrons in their outer shells (or two in the case of helium). These noble gas structures are thought of as being in some way a \"desirable\" thing for an atom to have. When other atoms react, they try to organise electrons such that their outer shells are either completely full or completely empty. Chemical reactions occur so that atoms attain inert gas configuration by either losing valency electrons as in the case of metals, or gaining electrons as in the case of non metals. Ionic bonding in sodium chloride Sodium (2,8,1) has 1 electron more than a stable noble gas structure (2,8). If it gave away that electron it would become more stable. Chlorine (2,8,7) has 1 electron short of a stable noble gas structure (2,8,8)."
"Ionic bonding in sodium chloride Sodium (2,8,1) has 1 electron more than a stable noble gas structure (2,8). If it gave away that electron it would become more stable. Chlorine (2,8,7) has 1 electron short of a stable noble gas structure (2,8,8). If it could gain an electron from somewhere it too would become more stable. If a sodium atom gives an electron to a chlorine atom, both become more stable. The sodium has lost an electron, so it no longer has equal numbers of electrons and protons. Because it has one more proton than electron, it has a charge of 1+. If electrons are lost from an atom, positive ions are formed. Positive ions are sometimes called cations because they move to the cathode during electrolysis. The chlorine has gained an electron, so it now has one more electron than proton. It therefore has a charge of 1-. If electrons are gained by an atom, negative ions are formed. A negative ion is sometimes called an anion since it drifts to the anode during electrolysis. The nature of ionic bond The sodium ions and chloride ions are held together by the strong electrostatic attractions between the positive and negative charges. You need one sodium atom to provide the extra electron for one chlorine atom, so they combine together 1:1. The formula is therefore NaCl. Properties of ionic compounds  All compounds with ionic bonding produce giant ionic structures.  Consist of oppositely charged ions arranged in an ionic lattice, the ions are held together by strong ionic bonds. e.g. NaCl is composed of Na+ ions and Cl- ions.  These bonds are hard to break, therefore ionic substances have very high melting and boiling points.  All exist as solids.  They conduct electricity when molten, because the ions are free to move, but do not conduct when solid.  They conduct electricity in the aqueous state because the ions are free to move.  Most ionic substances are soluble in water because the polar water molecules can accommodate the charged ions. COVALENT BONDING - SINGLE BONDS As well as achieving noble gas structures by transferring electrons from one atom to another as in ionic bonding, it is also possible for atoms to reach these stable structures by sharing electrons to give covalent bonds."
" They conduct electricity in the aqueous state because the ions are free to move.  Most ionic substances are soluble in water because the polar water molecules can accommodate the charged ions. COVALENT BONDING - SINGLE BONDS As well as achieving noble gas structures by transferring electrons from one atom to another as in ionic bonding, it is also possible for atoms to reach these stable structures by sharing electrons to give covalent bonds. Depending on the number of electron pairs shared between atoms which participate in bonding, covalent bonds are classified as follows: Some simple covalent molecules Chlorine For example, two chlorine atoms could both achieve stable structures by sharing their single unpaired electron as in the diagram. The fact that one chlorine has been drawn with electrons marked as crosses and the other as dots is simply to show where all the electrons come from. In reality there is no difference between them. The two chlorine atoms are said to be joined by a covalent bond. The reason that the two chlorine atoms stick together is that the shared pair of electrons is attracted to the nucleus of both chlorine atoms. Hydrogen Hydrogen atoms only need two electrons in their outer level to reach the noble gas structure of helium. Once again, the covalent bond holds the two atoms together because the pair of electrons is attracted to both nuclei. This is another single bond. Hydrogen chloride\nThe hydrogen has a helium structure, and the chlorine an argon structure. Water Oxygen atom has six electrons in the outer shell, while each of the two hydrogen atoms has one each. After bonding, oxygen has 8 electrons while each hydrogen atom has two as shown by the molecule. NITROGEN GAS Each nitrogen atom has five electrons in the outer shell. Each needs 3 electrons to complete the outer shell. In the formation of the molecule, each nitrogen atom contributes three electrons and a triple bond is formed Characteristics of Covalent Compounds 1) Covalent compounds consist of molecules and not ions. The molecules do not have any electric charge on them. The molecules are held together by weak forces called Van der Waal's forces. 2) Covalent compounds are gases, volatile liquids or soft solids. As there are weak, Van der Waal's forces between the molecules, they are not held in rigid position. The state depends on the bond energy. If the bond energy is very low, they stay as gases, if it is appreciable they are volatile liquids."
"As there are weak, Van der Waal's forces between the molecules, they are not held in rigid position. The state depends on the bond energy. If the bond energy is very low, they stay as gases, if it is appreciable they are volatile liquids. If very high, they exist as soft solids. 3) Covalent compounds generally have low melting and boiling points. As Van der Waal's forces are weak, a very small amount of energy is required to break the bond between the molecules corresponding to low melting point and boiling point. 4) Covalent compounds dissolve in organic solvents. As they do not contain ions, solvation does not take place when water is added to the compound. Hence they do not dissolve in water. 5) Covalent compounds are bad conductors of electricity. They do not contain ions in the fused state, nor do ions migrate on application of an electric potential. Hence, there is no conduction of current. 6) Covalent compounds are less dense when compared to water. Very weak Van der Waal's forces hold the molecules together, hence there are large inter molecular spaces. Consequently less number of molecules per unit volume, which means mass per unit volume is also less. Hence they have a low density. Exceptions  Diamond and graphite, the allotropes of carbon have high melting point.  Hydrogen chloride in the aqueous state conducts electricity. The giant covalent structure of diamond Carbon has an electronic arrangement of 2, 4. In diamond, each carbon shares electrons with four other carbon atoms - forming four single bonds. In the diagram some carbon atoms only seem to be forming two bonds (or even one bond), but that's not really the case. We are only showing a small bit of the whole structure. This is a giant covalent structure - it continues on and on in three dimensions. It is not a molecule, because the number of atoms joined up in a real diamond is completely variable - depending on the size of the crystal. The physical properties of diamond Diamond  Has a very high melting point (almost 4000°C). Very strong carbon-carbon covalent bonds have to be broken throughout the structure before melting occurs.  Is very hard. This is again due to the need to break very strong covalent bonds operating in 3dimensions.  Doesnಬt conduct electricity. All the electrons are held tightly between the atoms, and aren't free to move."
"This is again due to the need to break very strong covalent bonds operating in 3dimensions.  Doesnಬt conduct electricity. All the electrons are held tightly between the atoms, and aren't free to move.  Is insoluble in water and organic solvents. There are no possible attractions which could occur between solvent molecules and carbon atoms which could outweigh the attractions between the covalently bound carbon atoms. The giant covalent structure of graphite Graphite has a layer structure which is quite difficult to draw convincingly in three dimensions. The diagram below shows the arrangement of the atoms in each layer, and the way the layers are spaced. The bonding in graphite Each carbon atom uses three of its electrons to form simple bonds to its three close neighbours. That leaves a fourth electron in the bonding level. These \"spare\" electrons in each carbon atom become delocalised over the whole of the sheet of atoms in one layer. They are no longer associated directly with any particular atom or pair of atoms, but are free to wander throughout the whole sheet. The important thing is that the delocalised electrons are free to move anywhere within the sheet - each electron is no longer fixed to a particular carbon atom. There is, however, no direct contact between the delocalised electrons in one sheet and those in the neighbouring sheets. The atoms within a sheet are held together by strong covalent bonds - stronger, in fact, than in diamond because of the additional bonding caused by the delocalised electrons. So what holds the sheets together? In graphite you have the ultimate example of van der Waals dispersion forces. As the delocalised electrons move around in the sheet, very large temporary dipoles can be set up which will induce opposite dipoles in the sheets above and below - and so on throughout the whole graphite crystal. The physical properties of graphite Graphite  Has a high melting point, similar to that of diamond. In order to melt graphite, it isn't enough to loosen one sheet from another. You have to break the covalent bonding throughout the whole structure.  Has a soft, slippery feel, and is used in pencils and as a dry lubricant for things like locks. You can think of graphite rather like a pack of cards - each card is strong, but the cards will slide over each other, or even fall off the pack altogether. When you use a pencil, sheets are rubbed off and stick to the paper.  Has a lower density than diamond."
"You can think of graphite rather like a pack of cards - each card is strong, but the cards will slide over each other, or even fall off the pack altogether. When you use a pencil, sheets are rubbed off and stick to the paper.  Has a lower density than diamond. This is because of the relatively large amount of space that is \"wasted\" between the sheets.  Is insoluble in water and organic solvents - for the same reason that diamond is insoluble. Attractions between solvent molecules and carbon atoms will never be strong enough to overcome the strong covalent bonds in graphite.  Conducts electricity. The delocalised electrons are free to move throughout the sheets. If a piece of graphite is connected into a circuit, electrons can fall off one end of the sheet and be replaced with new ones at the other end. The structure of silicon dioxide, SiO2 Silicon dioxide is also known as silicon (IV) oxide. The giant covalent structure of silicon dioxide There are three different crystal forms of silicon dioxide. The easiest one to remember and draw is based on the diamond structure. Crystalline silicon has the same structure as diamond. To turn it into silicon dioxide, all you need to do is to modify the silicon structure by including some oxygen atoms. Notice that each silicon atom is bridged to its neighbours by an oxygen atom. Don't forget that this is just a tiny part of a giant structure extending on all 3 dimensions. The physical properties of silicon dioxide Silicon dioxide  Has a high melting point - varying depending on what the particular structure is (remember that the structure given is only one of three possible structures), but around 1700°C. Very strong silicon-oxygen covalent bonds have to be broken throughout the structure before melting occurs.  Is hard. This is due to the need to break the very strong covalent bonds.  Doesnಬt conduct electricity. There aren't any delocalised electrons. All the electrons are held tightly between the atoms, and aren't free to move.  Is insoluble in water and organic solvents. There are no possible attractions which could occur between solvent molecules and the silicon or oxygen atoms which could overcome the covalent bonds in the giant structure.

CO-ORDINATE (DATIVE COVALENT) BONDING Co-ordinate (dative covalent) bonding A covalent bond is formed by two atoms sharing a pair of electrons. The atoms are held together because the electron pair is attracted by both of the nuclei. In the formation of a simple covalent bond, each atom supplies one electron to the bond - but that doesn't have to be the case. A co-ordinate bond (also called a\ndative covalent bond) is a covalent bond (a shared pair of electrons) in which both electrons come from the same atom. The reaction between ammonia and hydrogen chloride If these colourless gases are allowed to mix, a thick white smoke of solid ammonium chloride is formed. Ammonium ions, NH4+, are formed by the transfer of a hydrogen ion from the hydrogen chloride to the lone pair of electrons on the ammonia molecule. When the ammonium ion, NH4+, is formed, the fourth hydrogen is attached by a dative covalent bond, because only the hydrogen's nucleus is transferred from the chlorine to the nitrogen. The hydrogen's electron is left behind on the chlorine to form a negative chloride ion. Once the ammonium ion has been formed it is impossible to tell any difference between the dative covalent and the ordinary covalent bonds. Although the electrons are shown differently in the diagram, there is no difference between them in reality. INTERMOLECULAR BONDING - VAN DER WAALS FORCES (a) VAN DER WAALS FORCES Intermolecular attractions are attractions between one molecule and a neighbouring molecule. The forces of attraction which hold an individual molecule together (for example, the covalent bonds) are known as\nintramolecular attractions. All molecules experience intermolecular attractions, although in some cases those attractions are very weak. Even in a gas like hydrogen, H2, if you slow the molecules down by cooling the gas, the attractions are large enough for the molecules to stick together eventually to form a liquid and then a solid."
"The forces of attraction which hold an individual molecule together (for example, the covalent bonds) are known as\nintramolecular attractions. All molecules experience intermolecular attractions, although in some cases those attractions are very weak. Even in a gas like hydrogen, H2, if you slow the molecules down by cooling the gas, the attractions are large enough for the molecules to stick together eventually to form a liquid and then a solid. In hydrogen's case the attractions are so weak that the molecules have to be cooled to (-252°C) before the attractions are enough to condense the hydrogen as a liquid. Helium's intermolecular attractions are even weaker - the molecules won't stick together to form a liquid until the temperature drops to (-269°C). HYDROGEN BONDING Polar molecules, such as water molecules, have a weak, partial negative charge at one region of the molecule (the oxygen atom in water) and a partial positive charge elsewhere (the hydrogen atoms in water). Thus when water molecules are close together, their positive and negative regions are attracted to the oppositely-charged regions of nearby molecules. The force of attraction, shown here as a dotted line, is called a hydrogen bond. Each water molecule is hydrogen bonded to four others. The hydrogen bonds that form between water molecules account for some of the essential — and unique — properties of water.  The attraction created by hydrogen bonds keeps water liquid over a wider range of temperature than is found for any other molecule its size.  The energy required to break multiple hydrogen bonds causes water to have a high heat of vaporization; that is; a large amount of energy is needed to convert liquid water, where the molecules are attracted through their hydrogen bonds, to water vapor, where they are not. Liquid Water and Hydrogen Bonding Why water is a liquid? In many ways, water is a miracle liquid. Since the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the molecule carry opposite (though partial) charges, nearby water molecules are attracted to each other like tiny little magnets.

"Hydrogen bonding makes water molecules \"stick\" together. This makes water have high melting and boiling points compared to other covalent compounds such as ammonia (NH3) which have similar molecular mass but are gases Ice and Hydrogen Bonding The structure that forms in the solid ice crystal actually has large holes in it. Therefore, in a given volume of ice, there are fewer water molecules than in the same volume of liquid water. In other words, ice is less dense than liquid water and will float on the surface of the liquid. Surface Tension and hydrogen bonding As we just discussed, neighboring water molecules are attracted to one another. Molecules at the surface of liquid water have fewer neighbors and, as a result, have a greater attraction to the few water molecules that are nearby. This enhanced attraction is called surface tension. It makes the surface of the liquid slightly more difficult to break through than the interior. Water as a Solvent The partial charge that develops across the water molecule helps make it an excellent solvent. Water dissolves many substances by surrounding charged particles and \"pulling\" them into solution. For example, common table salt, sodium chloride, is an ionic substance that contains alternating sodium and chlorine ions. When table salt is added to water, the partial charges on the water molecule are attracted to the Na+ and Cl- ions. Why does ethanol have a higher boiling point than methoxymethane? Ethanol, CH3CH2-O-H, and methoxymethane, CH3-O-CH3, both have the same molecular formula, C2H6O. They have the same number of electrons, and a similar length to the molecule. The van der Waals attractions (both dispersion forces and dipole-dipole attractions) in each will be much the same. However, ethanol has a hydrogen atom attached directly to oxygen - and that oxygen still has exactly the same two lone pairs as in a water molecule. Hydrogen bonding can occur between ethanol molecules, although not as effectively as in water. The hydrogen bonding is limited by the fact that there is only one hydrogen in each ethanol molecule with sufficient + charge. In methoxymethane, the lone pairs on the oxygen are still there, but the hydrogens aren't sufficiently + for hydrogen bonds to form. Except in some rather unusual cases, the hydrogen atom has to be attached directly to the very electronegative element for hydrogen bonding to occur."
"The hydrogen bonding is limited by the fact that there is only one hydrogen in each ethanol molecule with sufficient + charge.

Except in some rather unusual cases, the hydrogen atom has to be attached directly to the very electronegative element for hydrogen bonding to occur. The boiling points of ethanol and methoxymethane show the dramatic effect that the hydrogen bonding has on the stickiness of the ethanol molecules:\nethanol (with hydrogen bonding) 78.5°C methoxymethane (without hydrogen bonding) -24.8°C The hydrogen bonding in the ethanol has lifted its boiling point about 100°C.It is important to realise that hydrogen bonding exists in addition to van der Waals attractions. For example, all the following molecules contain the same number of electrons, and the first two are much the same length. The higher boiling point of the butan-1-ol is due to the additional hydrogen bonding. 4. BONDING IN METALS Bonding in metals Metal atoms have relatively few electrons in their outer shells. When they are packed together, each metal atom loses its outer electrons into a ಫseaಬ of free electrons (or mobile electrons). Having lost electrons, the atoms are no longer electrically neutral. They become positive ions because they have lost electrons but the number of protons in the nucleus has remained unchanged. Therefore the structure of a metal is made up of positive ions packed together. These ions are surrounded by electrons, which can move freely between the ions.  An ion is a charged particle made from an atom by the loss or gain of electrons.  Metal atoms most easily lose electrons, so they become positive ions. In doing so they achieve a more stable electron arrangement, usually that of the nearest noble gas. These free electrons are delocalized (not restricted to orbiting one positive ion) and form a kind of electrostatic ಫglueಬ holding the structure together. In an electrical circuit, metals can conduct electricity because the mobile electrons can move through the structure carrying charge. His type of bonding (called metallic boding) is present in alloys as well. Alloys, for example solder and brass, will conduct electricity. The physical properties of metals: This strong bonding generally results in dense, strong materials with high melting and boiling points."
"His type of bonding (called metallic boding) is present in alloys as well. Alloys, for example solder and brass, will conduct electricity. The physical properties of metals: This strong bonding generally results in dense, strong materials with high melting and boiling points. Usually a relatively large amount of energy is needed to melt or boil metals. a. Metals are good conductors of electricity because these 'free' electrons carry the charge of an electric current when a potential difference (voltage!) is applied across a piece of metal. b. Metals are also good conductors of heat. This is also due to the free moving electrons. Nonmetallic solids conduct heat energy by hotter more strongly vibrating atoms, knocking against cooler less strongly vibrating atoms to pass the particle kinetic energy on. In metals, as well as this effect, the 'hot' high kinetic energy electrons move around freely to transfer the particle kinetic energy more efficiently to 'cooler' atoms. c. Typical metals also have a silvery surface but remember this may be easily tarnished by corrosive oxidation in air and water. d. Unlike ionic solids, metals are very malleable, they can be readily bent, pressed or hammered into shape. INTRODUCTION TO SALTS 1.(a) A salt is an ionic compound formed when the cation from a base combine with the anion derived from an acid. A salt is therefore formed when the hydrogen ions in an acid are replaced wholly/fully or partially/partly ,directly or indirectly by a metal or ammonium radical. (b) The number of ionizable/replaceable hydrogen in an acid is called basicity of an acid. Some acids are therefore: (i)monobasic acids generally denoted HX e.g. HCl, HNO3,HCOOH,CH3COOH. (ii)dibasic acids ; generally denoted H2X e.g. H2SO4, H2SO3, H2CO3,HOOCOOH. (iii)tribasic acids ; generally denoted H3X e.g. H3PO4. (c) Some salts are normal salts while other are acid salts. (i)A normal salt is formed when all the ionizable /replaceable hydrogen in an acid is replaced by a metal or metallic /ammonium radical. (ii)An acid salt is formed when part/portion the ionizable /replaceable hydrogen in an acid is replaced by a metal or metallic /ammonium radical."

A compound that is decomposed by an electric current is called an electrolyte. Some electrolytes are weak while others are strong. 2.Strong electrolytes are those that are fully ionized/dissociated into (many) ions. Common strong electrolytes include: (i)all mineral acids (ii)all strong alkalis/sodium hydroxide/potassium hydroxide. (iii)all soluble salts 3.Weak electrolytes are those that are partially/partly ionized/dissociated into (few) ions. Common weak electrolytes include: (i)all organic acids (ii)all bases except sodium hydroxide/potassium hydroxide. (iii)Water 4. A compound that is not decomposed by an electric current is called nonelectrolyte."
"Common weak electrolytes include: (i)all organic acids (ii)all bases except sodium hydroxide/potassium hydroxide. (iii)Water 4. A compound that is not decomposed by an electric current is called nonelectrolyte. Non-electrolytes are those compounds /substances that exist as molecules and thus cannot ionize/dissociate into(any) ions . Common non-electrolytes include: (i) most organic solvents (e.g. petrol/paraffin/benzene/methylbenzene/ethanol) (ii)all hydrocarbons(alkanes /alkenes/alkynes) (iii)Chemicals of life(e.g. proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, starch, sugar) 5. An electrolytes in solid state have fused /joined ions and therefore do not conduct electricity but the ions (cations and anions) are free and mobile in molten and aqueous (solution, dissolved in water) state. 6.During electrolysis, the free ions are attracted to the electrodes. An electrode is a rod through which current enter and leave the electrolyte during electrolysis. 2 An electrode that does not influence/alter the products of electrolysis is called an inert electrode. Common inert electrodes include: (i)Platinum (ii)Carbon graphite Platinum is not usually used in a school laboratory because it is very expensive. Carbon graphite is easily/readily and cheaply available (from used dry cells). 7.The positive electrode is called Anode.The anode is the electrode through which current enter the electrolyte/electrons leave the electrolyte 8.The negative electrode is called Cathode. The cathode is the electrode through which current leave the electrolyte / electrons enter the electrolyte 9. During the electrolysis, free anions are attracted to the anode where they lose /donate electrons to form neutral atoms/molecules. i.e. M(l) -> M+(l) + e (for cations from molten electrolytes) M(s) -> M+(aq) + e (for cations from electrolytes in aqueous state / solution / dissolved in water) The neutral atoms /molecules form the products of electrolysis at the anode. This is called discharge at anode 10. During electrolysis, free cations are attracted to the cathode where they gain /accept/acquire electrons to form neutral atoms/molecules."

"Scientists have tried to group them together in a periodic table. A periodic table is a horizontal and vertical arrangement of elements according to their atomic numbers. This table was successfully arranged in 1913 by the British scientist Henry Moseley from the previous work of the Russian Scientist Dmitri Mendeleev. The horizontal arrangement forms period. Atoms in the same period have the same the same number of energy levels in their electronic structure. i.e. The number of energy levels in the electronic configuration of an element determine the period to which the element is in the periodic table. e.g. Which period of the periodic table are the following isotopes/elements/atoms? a) 126C Electron structure 2:4 => 2 energy levels used thus Period 2 b) 2311Na Electron structure 2:8:1 => 3 energy levels used thus Period 3 c) 3919K Electron structure 2:8:8:1 => 4 energy levels used thus Period 4 d) 11H Electron structure 1: => 1 energy level used thus Period 1 The vertical arrangement of elements forms a group. Atoms in the same have the same the same group have the same number of outer energy level electrons as per their electronic structure. i.e. The number of electrons in the outer energy level an element determine the group to which the element is ,in the periodic table. 13 a) 126C Electron structure 2:4 => 4 electrons in outer energy level thus Group IV b) 2311C Electron structure 2:8:1 => 1 electron in outer energy level thus Group I c) 3919K Electron structure 2:8:8:1=>1 electron in outer energy level thus Group I d) 11H Electron structure 1: => 1 electron in outer energy level thus Group I By convention; (i)Periods are named using English numerals 1,2,3,4,… (ii)Groups are named using Roman numerals I,II,III,IV,… There are eighteen groups in a standard periodic table. There are seven periods in a standard periodic table. When an atom has maximum number of electrons in its outer energy level, it is said to be stable. When an atom has no maximum number of electrons in its outer energy level, it is said to be unstable. All stable atoms are in group 8/18 of the periodic table. All other elements are unstable."

A chemical reaction involves gaining or losing outer electrons (electron transfer) .When electron transfer take place, an ion is formed. An ion is formed when an unstable atom gain or donate electrons in its outer energy level inorder to be stable. Whether an atom gain or donate electrons depend on the relative energy required to donate or gain extra electrons i.e. Examples 1. 199 F has electronic structure/configuration 2:7. It can donate the seven outer electrons to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:. It can gain one extra electron to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:8. Gaining requires less energy, and thus Fluorine reacts by gaining one extra electrons. 2. 2313 Al has electronic structure/configuration 2:8:3 It can donate the three outer electrons to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:8. It can gain five extra electrons to have stable electronic structure/configuration 2:8:8. Donating requires less energy, and thus Aluminium reacts by donating its three outer electrons. Elements with less than four electrons in the outer energy level donates /lose the outer electrons to be stable and form a positively charged ion called cation. A cation therefore has more protons(positive charge) than electrons(negative charge) Generally metals usually form cation Elements with more than four electrons in the outer energy level gain /acquire extra electrons in the outer energy level to be stable and form a negatively charged ion called anion. An anion therefore has less protons(positive charge) than electrons(negative charge) Generally non metals usually form anion. Except Hydrogen The charge carried by an ion is equal to the number of electrons gained/acquired or donated/lost. Examples of ion formation 1.11H H -> H+ + e (atom) (monovalent cation) (electrons donated/lost) Electronic configuration 1: (No electrons remains)\n15 2. 2713 Al Al -> Al3+ + 3e (atom) (trivalent cation) (3 electrons donated/lost) Electron 2:8:3 2:8 structure (unstable) (stable) 3."
"199F F + e -> F- (atom) ( 1 electrons gained/acquired) (anion) Electron 2:7 2:8 structure (unstable) (stable) 9. 3517Cl\n16 Cl + e -> Cl- (atom) ( 1 electrons gained/acquired) (anion) Electron 2:8:7 2:8:8 structure (unstable) (stable) 3. 3919 K K -> K+ + e (atom) (cation) ( 1 electrons donated/lost) Electron 2:8:8:1 2:8:8 structure (unstable) (stable) When an element donate/loses its outer electrons ,the process is called oxidation. When an element acquires/gains extra electrons in its outer energy level,the process is called reduction.The charge carried by an atom, cation or anion is its oxidation state.

The number of valence electrons and the number of occupied energy levels in an atom of an element determine the position of an element in the periodic table.i.e The number of occupied energy levels determine the Period and the valence electrons determine the Group. Elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties. The trends in physical and chemical properties of elements in the same group vary down the group. Elements in the same group thus constitute a chemical family. (a) Group I elements: Alkali metals Group I elements are called Alkali metals except Hydrogen which is a non metal. The alkali metals include: Element Symbol Atomic number Electron structure Oxidation state Valency Lithium Li 3 2:1 Li+ 1 Sodium Na 11 2:8:1 Na+ 1 Potassium K 19 2:8:8:1 K+ 1 Rubidium Rb 37 2:8:18:8:1 Rb+ 1 Caesium Cs 55 2:8:18:18:8:1 Cs+ 1 Francium Fr 87 2:8:18:32:18:8:1 Fr+ 1 All alkali metals atom has one electron in the outer energy level."

They therefore are monovalent. They donate /lose the outer electron to have oxidation state M+ The number of energy levels increases down the group from Lithium to Francium. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size of Potassium is bigger/larger than that of sodium because Potassium has more/4 energy levels than sodium (3 energy levels). Atomic and ionic radius The distance between the centre of the nucleus of an atom and the outermost energy level occupied by electron/s is called atomic radius. Atomic radius is measured in nanometers(n).The higher /bigger the atomic radius the bigger /larger the atomic size. The distance between the centre of the nucleus of an ion and the outermost energy level occupied by electron/s is called ionic radius. Ionic radius is also\n28 measured in nanometers(n).The higher /bigger the ionic radius the bigger /larger the size of the ion.

"Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkali metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkali metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because alkali metals react by losing/donating the outer electron and hence lose the outer energy level. Table showing the atomic and ionic radius of some alkali metals Element Symbol Atomic number Atomic radius(nM) Ionic radius(nM) Lithium Li 3 0.133 0.060 Sodium Na 11 0.157 0.095 Potassium K 19 0.203 0.133 The atomic radius of sodium is 0.157nM .The ionic radius of Na+ is 0.095nM. This is because sodium reacts by donating/losing the outer electrons and hence the outer energy level. The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. Electropositivity The ease of donating/losing electrons is called electropositivity. All alkali metals are electropositive. Electropositivity increase as atomic radius increase. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The outer electrons experience less nuclear attraction and can be lost/ donated easily/with ease. Francium is the most electropositive element in the periodic table because it has the highest/biggest atomic radius. Ionization energy The minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom of element in its gaseous state is called 1st ionization energy. The SI unit of ionization energy is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 .Ionization energy depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer electrons/energy level and thus the lower the ionization energy. For alkali metals the 1st ionization energy decrease down the group as\n29 the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. e.g. The 1st ionization energy of sodium is 496 kJmole-1 while that of potassium is 419 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from sodium to Potassium. It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electrons in Potassium than in sodium."

The softness and ease of cutting increase down the group from Lithium to Francium. This is because an increase in atomic radius, decreases the strength of metallic bond and the packing of the metallic structure Appearance: Alkali metals have a shiny grey metallic luster when freshly cut. The surface rapidly/quickly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface rapidly/quickly reacts with elements of air/oxygen. Melting and boiling points: Alkali metals have a relatively low melting/boiling point than common metals like Iron. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weak metallic bond/structure. Electrical/thermal conductivity: Alkali metals are good thermal and electrical conductors. Metals conduct using the outer mobile delocalized electrons. The delocalized electrons move randomly within the metallic structure.

They therefore float in water.They react with water to form a strongly alkaline solution of their hydroxides and producing hydrogen gas. The rate of this reaction increase down the group. i.e. Potassium is more reactive than sodium .Sodium is more reactive than Lithium.

The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Calcium is bigger/larger than that of Magnesium because Calcium has more/4 energy levels than Magnesium (3 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkaline earth metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkaline earth metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because they react by losing/donating the two outer electrons and hence lose the outer energy level.

This is because Magnesium reacts by donating/losing the two outer electrons and hence the outer energy level.

Electropositivity All alkaline earth metals are also electropositive like alkali metals. The electropositivity increase with increase in atomic radius/size."
"The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. Electropositivity All alkaline earth metals are also electropositive like alkali metals. The electropositivity increase with increase in atomic radius/size. Calcium is more electropositive than Magnesium. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The two outer electrons in calcium experience less nuclear attraction and can be lost/ donated easily/with ease because of the higher/bigger atomic radius. Ionization energy For alkaline earth metals the 1st ionization energy decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. e.g. The 1st ionization energy of Magnesium is 900 kJmole-1 while that of Calcium is 590 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from magnesium to calcium. It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electron in calcium than in magnesium. The minimum amount of energy required to remove a second electron from an ion of an element in its gaseous state is called the 2nd ionization energy. The 2nd ionization energy is always higher /bigger than the 1st ionization energy. This because once an electron is donated /lost form an atom, the overall effective nuclear attraction on the remaining electrons/energy level increase. Removing a second electron from the ion require therefore more energy than the first electron. The atomic radius of alkali metals is higher/bigger than that of alkaline earth metals.This is because across/along the period from left to right there is an increase in nuclear charge from additional number of protons and still additional number of electrons entering the same energy level. Increase in nuclear charge increases the effective nuclear attraction on the outer energy level which pulls it closer to the nucleus. e.g. Atomic radius of Sodium (0.157nM) is higher than that of Magnesium (0.137nM). This is because Magnesium has more effective nuclear attraction on\n35 the outer energy level than Sodium hence pulls outer energy level more nearer to its nucleus. Physical properties Soft/Easy to cut: Alkaline earth metals are not soft and easy to cut with a knife like alkali metals."
"Atomic radius of Sodium (0.157nM) is higher than that of Magnesium (0.137nM). This is because Magnesium has more effective nuclear attraction on\n35 the outer energy level than Sodium hence pulls outer energy level more nearer to its nucleus. Physical properties Soft/Easy to cut: Alkaline earth metals are not soft and easy to cut with a knife like alkali metals. This is because of the decrease in atomic radius of corresponding alkaline earth metal, increases the strength of metallic bond and the packing of the metallic structure. Alkaline earth metals are (i)ductile(able to form wire/thin long rods) (ii)malleable(able to be hammered into sheet/long thin plates) (iii)have high tensile strength(able to be coiled without breaking/ not brittle/withstand stress) Appearance: Alkali earth metals have a shiny grey metallic luster when their surface is freshly polished /scrubbed. The surface slowly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface slowly undergoes oxidation to form an oxide. This oxide layer should be removed before using the alkaline earth metals. Melting and boiling points: Alkaline earth metals have a relatively high melting/ boiling point than alkali metals. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weaker metallic bond/structure. Alkaline earth metals use two delocalized electrons to form a stronger metallic bond /structure. The melting and boiling points decrease down the group as the atomic radius/size increase reducing the strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure. e.g. Beryllium has a melting point of 1280oC. Magnesium has a melting point of 650oC.Beryllium has a smaller atomic radius/size than magnesium .The strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure is thus stronger in beryllium. Electrical/thermal conductivity: Alkaline earth metals are good thermal and electrical conductors. The two delocalized valence electrons move randomly within the metallic structure. Electrical conductivity increase down the group as the atomic radius/size increase making the delocalized outer electrons less attracted to nucleus. Alkaline earth metals are better thermal and electrical conductors than alkali metals because they have more/two outer delocalized electrons.e.g. Magnesium is a better conductor than sodium because it has more/two delocalized electrons than sodium."

(c)Group VII elements: Halogens Group VII elements are called Halogens. They are all non metals.

They acquire/gain one electron in the outer energy level to be stable. They therefore are therefore monovalent .They exist in oxidation state X- The number of energy levels increases down the group from Fluorine to Astatine. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g."
"They therefore are therefore monovalent .They exist in oxidation state X- The number of energy levels increases down the group from Fluorine to Astatine. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Chlorine is bigger/larger than that of Fluorine because Chlorine has more/3 energy levels than Fluorine (2 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of Halogens increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of Halogens is smaller than the ionic radius. This is because they react by gaining/acquiring extra one electron in the outer energy level. The effective nuclear attraction on the more/extra electrons decreases. The incoming extra electron is also repelled causing the outer energy level to expand to reduce the repulsion and accommodate more electrons. Table showing the atomic and ionic radius of four Halogens\n42 Element Symbol Atomic number Atomic radius(nM) Ionic radius(nM) Fluorine F 9 0.064 0.136 Chlorine Cl 17 0.099 0.181 Bromine Br 35 0.114 0.195 Iodine I 53 0.133 0.216 The atomic radius of Chlorine is 0.099nM .The ionic radius of Cl- is 0.181nM. This is because Chlorine atom/molecule reacts by gaining/acquiring extra one electrons. The more/extra electrons/energy level experience less effective nuclear attraction /pull towards the nucleus .The outer enegy level expand/increase to reduce the repulsion of the existing and incoming gained /acquired electrons. Electronegativity The ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons is called electronegativity. All halogens are electronegative. Electronegativity decreases as atomic radius increase. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The outer electrons experience less nuclear attraction and thus ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons decrease. It is measured using Pauling’s scale. Where Fluorine with Pauling scale 4.0 is the most electronegative element and thus the highest tendency to acquire/gain extra electron. Table showing the electronegativity of the halogens."
"It is measured using Pauling’s scale. Where Fluorine with Pauling scale 4.0 is the most electronegative element and thus the highest tendency to acquire/gain extra electron. Table showing the electronegativity of the halogens. Halogen F Cl Br I At Electronegativity (Pauling scale) 4.0 3.0 2.8 2.5 2.2 The electronegativity of the halogens decrease down the group from fluorine to Astatine. This is because atomic radius increases down the group and thus decrease electron – attracting power down the group from fluorine to astatine. Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table because it has the small atomic radius. Electron affinity The minimum amount of energy required to gain/acquire an extra electron by an atom of element in its gaseous state is called 1st electron affinity. The SI unit of electron affinity is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 . Electron affinity depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons and thus the lower the electron affinity. For halogens the 1st electron affinity decrease down the group as the\n43 atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. Due to its small size/atomic radius Fluorine shows exceptionally low electron affinity. This is because a lot of energy is required to overcome the high repulsion of the existing and incoming electrons. Table showing the election affinity of halogens for the process X + e -> X- The higher the electron affinity the more stable theion.i.e Cl- is a more stable ion than Br- because it has a more negative / exothermic electron affinity than Br- Electron affinity is different from: (i) Ionization energy. Ionization energy is the energy required to lose/donate an electron in an atom of an element in its gaseous state while electron affinity is the energy required to gain/acquire extra electron by an atom of an element in its gaseous state. (ii) Electronegativity. -Electron affinity is the energy required to gain an electron in an atom of an element in gaseous state. It involves the process: X(g) + e -> X-(g) Electronegativity is the ease/tendency of gaining/ acquiring electrons by an element during chemical reactions."
"(ii) Electronegativity. -Electron affinity is the energy required to gain an electron in an atom of an element in gaseous state. It involves the process: X(g) + e -> X-(g) Electronegativity is the ease/tendency of gaining/ acquiring electrons by an element during chemical reactions. It does not involve use of energy but theoretical arbitrary Pauling’ scale of measurements. Physical properties State at room temperature Fluorine and Chlorine are gases, Bromine is a liquid and Iodine is a solid. Astatine is radioactive . All halogens exist as diatomic molecules bonded by strong covalent bond. Each molecule is joined to the other by weak intermolecular forces/ Van-der-waals forces. Melting/Boiling point The strength of intermolecular/Van-der-waals forces of attraction increase with increase in molecular size/atomic radius. Iodine has therefore the largest atomic radius and thus strongest intermolecular forces to make it a solid. Iodine sublimes when heated to form (caution: highly toxic/poisonous) purple vapour. Halogen F Cl Br I Electron affinity kJmole-1 -333 -364 -342 -295\n44 This is because Iodine molecules are held together by weak van-derwaals/intermolecular forces which require little heat energy to break. Electrical conductivity All Halogens are poor conductors of electricity because they have no free delocalized electrons. Solubility in polar and non-polar solvents All halogens are soluble in water(polar solvent). When a boiling tube containing either chlorine gas or bromine vapour is separately inverted in a beaker containing distilled water and tetrachloromethane (non-polar solvent), the level of solution in boiling tube rises in both water and tetrachloromethane. This is because halogen are soluble in both polar and non-polar solvents. Solubility of halogens in water/polar solvents decrease down the group. Solubility of halogens in non-polar solvent increase down the group. The level of water in chlorine is higher than in bromine and the level of tetrachloromethane in chlorine is lower than in bromine. Caution: Tetrachloromethane , Bromine vapour and Chlorine gas are all highly toxic/poisonous."

Using Bromine water Yellow colour of bromine water fades in test tubes containing sodium iodide. -Coloured Solution formed. Explanation The halogens displace each other from their solution. The more electronegative displace the less electronegative from their solution. Chlorine is more electronegative than bromine and iodine. On adding chlorine water, bromine and Iodine are displaced from their solutions by chlorine. Bromine is more electronegative than iodide but less 6than chlorine. On adding Bromine water, iodine is displaced from its solution but not chlorine."

Explain the trend in bond Energy of the halogens above: -Decrease down the group from chlorine to Iodine -Atomic radius increase down the group decreasing the energy required to break the covalent bonds between the larger atom with reduced effective nuclear @ charge an outer energy level that take part in bonding. (c)Group VIII elements: Noble gases Group VIII elements are called Noble gases. They are all non metals. Noble gases occupy about 1.0% of the atmosphere as colourless gaseous mixture. Argon is the most abundant with 0.9%. They exists as monatomic molecules with very weak van-der-waals /intermolecular forces holding the molecules. They include: All noble gas atoms have a stable duplet(two electrons in the 1st energy level) or octet(eight electrons in other outer energy level)in the outer energy level. They therefore do not acquire/gain extra electron in the outer energy level or donate/lose. They therefore are therefore zerovalent . The number of energy levels increases down the group from Helium to Randon."
"They therefore do not acquire/gain extra electron in the outer energy level or donate/lose. They therefore are therefore zerovalent . The number of energy levels increases down the group from Helium to Randon. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size/radius. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Argon is bigger/larger than that of Neon because Argon has more/3 energy levels than Neon (2 energy levels). Atomic radius noble gases increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The effective nuclear attraction on the outer electrons thus decrease down the group. The noble gases are generally unreactive because the outer energy level has the stable octet/duplet. The stable octet/duplet in noble gas atoms lead to a Element Symbol Atomic number Electron structure State at room temperature Helium He 2 2: Colourless gas Neon Ne 10 2:8 Colourless gas Argon Ar 18 2:8:8 Colourless gas Krypton Kr 36 2:8:18:8 Colourless gas Xenon Xe 54 2:8:18:18:8 Colourless gas Radon Rn 86 2:8:18:32:18:8 Radioctive\n48 comparatively very high 1st ionization energy. This is because losing /donating an electron from the stable atom require a lot of energy to lose/donate and make it unstable. As atomic radius increase down the group and the 1st ionization energy decrease, very electronegative elements like Oxygen and Fluorine are able to react and bond with lower members of the noble gases.e.g Xenon reacts with Fluorine to form a covalent compound XeF6.This is because the outer electrons/energy level if Xenon is far from the nucleus and thus experience less effective nuclear attraction. Noble gases have low melting and boiling points. This is because they exist as monatomic molecules joined by very weak intermolecular/van-der-waals forces that require very little energy to weaken and form liquid and break to form a gas. The intermolecular/van-der-waals forces increase down the group as the atomic radius/size increase from Helium to Radon. The melting and boiling points thus increase also down the group. Noble gases are insoluble in water and are poor conductors of electricity."

Neon is used in street and advertisement light Helium is mixed with Oxygen during deep sea diving and mountaineering. Helium is used in weather balloon for meteorological research instead of Hydrogen because it is unreactive/inert.Hydrogen when impure can ignite with an explosion. Helium is used in making thermometers for measuring very low temperatures. 49 C. PERIODICITY OF ACROSS THE PERIOD. (See Chemical bonding and Structure)\nPERIODICITY OF CHEMICAL FAMILES (Patterns down the group) The number of valence electrons and the number of occupied energy levels in an atom of an element determine the position of an element in the periodic table. i.e The number of occupied energy levels determine the Period and the valence electrons determine the Group. Elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties. The trends in physical and chemical properties of elements in the same group vary down the group. Elements in the same group thus constitute a chemical family. (a) Group I elements: Alkali metals Group I elements are called Alkali metals except Hydrogen which is a non metal."
"The trends in physical and chemical properties of elements in the same group vary down the group. Elements in the same group thus constitute a chemical family.

They therefore are monovalent. They donate /lose the outer electron to have oxidation state M+ The number of energy levels increases down the group from Lithium to Francium. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size of Potassium is bigger/larger than that of sodium because Potassium has more/4 energy levels than sodium (3 energy levels). Atomic and ionic radius The distance between the centre of the nucleus of an atom and the outermost energy level occupied by electron/s is called atomic radius. Atomic radius is measured in nanometers(n).The higher /bigger the atomic radius the bigger /larger the atomic size. 2 The distance between the centre of the nucleus of an ion and the outermost energy level occupied by electron/s is called ionic radius. Ionic radius is also measured in nanometers(n).The higher /bigger the ionic radius the bigger /larger the size of the ion. Atomic radius and ionic radius depend on the number of energy levels occupied by electrons.

"The atomic radius of Francium is bigger/larger than that of sodium because Francium has more/7 energy levels than sodium (3 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkali metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkali metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because alkali metals react by losing/donating the outer electron and hence lose the outer energy level.

This is because sodium reacts by donating/losing the outer electrons and hence the outer energy level. The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. Electropositivity The ease of donating/losing electrons is called electropositivity. All alkali metals are electropositive. Electropositivity increase as atomic radius increase. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The outer electrons experience less nuclear attraction and can be lost/ donated easily/with ease. Francium is the most electropositive element in the periodic table because it has the highest/biggest atomic radius. Ionization energy\n3 The minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom of element in its gaseous state is called 1st ionization energy. The SI unit of ionization energy is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 .Ionization energy depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer electrons/energy level and thus the lower the ionization energy. For alkali metals the 1st ionization energy decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. e.g. The 1st ionization energy of sodium is 496 kJmole-1 while that of potassium is 419 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from sodium to Potassium."

It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electrons in Potassium than in sodium. Physical properties Soft/Easy to cut: Alkali metals are soft and easy to cut with a knife. The softness and ease of cutting increase down the group from Lithium to Francium. This is because an increase in atomic radius, decreases the strength of metallic bond and the packing of the metallic structure Appearance: Alkali metals have a shiny grey metallic luster when freshly cut. The surface rapidly/quickly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface rapidly/quickly reacts with elements of air/oxygen. Melting and boiling points: Alkali metals have a relatively low melting/boiling point than common metals like Iron. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weak metallic bond/structure. Electrical/thermal conductivity: Alkali metals are good thermal and electrical conductors. Metals conduct using the outer mobile delocalized electrons. The delocalized electrons move randomly within the metallic structure.

They therefore float in water.They react with water to form a strongly alkaline solution of their hydroxides and producing hydrogen gas. The rate of this reaction increase down the group. i.e. Potassium is more reactive than sodium .Sodium is more reactive than Lithium.

They therefore are divalent. They donate /lose the two outer electrons to have oxidation state M2+ The number of energy levels increases down the group from Beryllium to Radium. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g."
"They donate /lose the two outer electrons to have oxidation state M2+ The number of energy levels increases down the group from Beryllium to Radium. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Calcium is bigger/larger than that of Magnesium because Calcium has more/4 energy levels than Magnesium (3 energy levels). Atomic radius and ionic radius of alkaline earth metals increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of alkaline earth metals is bigger than the ionic radius. This is because they react by losing/donating the two outer electrons and hence lose the outer energy level. Table showing the atomic and ionic radius of the 1st three alkaline earth metals Element Symbol Atomic number Atomic radius(nM) Ionic radius(nM) Beryllium Be 4 0.089 0.031 Magnesium Mg 12 0.136 0.065 Calcium Ca 20 0.174 0.099 The atomic radius of Magnesium is 0.136nM .The ionic radius of Mg2+ is 0.065nM. This is because Magnesium reacts by donating/losing the two outer electrons and hence the outer energy level. The remaining electrons/energy levels experience more effective / greater nuclear attraction/pull towards the nucleus reducing the atomic radius. 9 Electropositivity All alkaline earth metals are also electropositive like alkali metals. The electropositivity increase with increase in atomic radius/size. Calcium is more electropositive than Magnesium. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The two outer electrons in calcium experience less nuclear attraction and can be lost/ donated easily/with ease because of the higher/bigger atomic radius. Ionization energy For alkaline earth metals the 1st ionization energy decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. e.g. The 1st ionization energy of Magnesium is 900 kJmole-1 while that of Calcium is 590 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from magnesium to calcium. It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electron in calcium than in magnesium."
"e.g. The 1st ionization energy of Magnesium is 900 kJmole-1 while that of Calcium is 590 kJmole-1 .This is because atomic radius increase and thus effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease down the group from magnesium to calcium. It requires therefore less energy to donate/lose outer electron in calcium than in magnesium. The minimum amount of energy required to remove a second electron from an ion of an element in its gaseous state is called the 2nd ionization energy. The 2nd ionization energy is always higher /bigger than the 1st ionization energy. This because once an electron is donated /lost form an atom, the overall effective nuclear attraction on the remaining electrons/energy level increase. Removing a second electron from the ion require therefore more energy than the first electron. The atomic radius of alkali metals is higher/bigger than that of alkaline earth metals.This is because across/along the period from left to right there is an increase in nuclear charge from additional number of protons and still additional number of electrons entering the same energy level. Increase in nuclear charge increases the effective nuclear attraction on the outer energy level which pulls it closer to the nucleus. e.g. Atomic radius of Sodium (0.157nM) is higher than that of Magnesium (0.137nM). This is because Magnesium has more effective nuclear attraction on the outer energy level than Sodium hence pulls outer energy level more nearer to its nucleus. Physical properties Soft/Easy to cut: Alkaline earth metals are not soft and easy to cut with a knife like alkali metals. This is because of the decrease in atomic radius of\n10 corresponding alkaline earth metal, increases the strength of metallic bond and the packing of the metallic structure. Alkaline earth metals are (i)ductile(able to form wire/thin long rods) (ii)malleable(able to be hammered into sheet/long thin plates) (iii)have high tensile strength(able to be coiled without breaking/ not brittle/withstand stress) Appearance: Alkali earth metals have a shiny grey metallic luster when their surface is freshly polished /scrubbed. The surface slowly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface slowly undergoes oxidation to form an oxide. This oxide layer should be removed before using the alkaline earth metals."
"The surface slowly tarnishes on exposure to air. This is because the metal surface slowly undergoes oxidation to form an oxide. This oxide layer should be removed before using the alkaline earth metals. Melting and boiling points: Alkaline earth metals have a relatively high melting/ boiling point than alkali metals. This is because alkali metals use only one delocalized electron to form a weaker metallic bond/structure. Alkaline earth metals use two delocalized electrons to form a stronger metallic bond /structure. The melting and boiling points decrease down the group as the atomic radius/size increase reducing the strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure. e.g. Beryllium has a melting point of 1280oC. Magnesium has a melting point of 650oC.Beryllium has a smaller atomic radius/size than magnesium .The strength of metallic bond and packing of the metallic structure is thus stronger in beryllium. Electrical/thermal conductivity: Alkaline earth metals are good thermal and electrical conductors. The two delocalized valence electrons move randomly within the metallic structure. Electrical conductivity increase down the group as the atomic radius/size increase making the delocalized outer electrons less attracted to nucleus. Alkaline earth metals are better thermal and electrical conductors than alkali metals because they have more/two outer delocalized electrons.e.g. Magnesium is a better conductor than sodium because it has more/two delocalized electrons than sodium. The more delocalized electrons the better the electrical conductor. Calcium is a better conductor than magnesium. Calcium has bigger/larger atomic radius than magnesium because the delocalized electrons are less attracted to the nucleus of calcium and thus more free /mobile and thus better the electrical conductor Summary of some physical properties of the 1st three alkaline earth metals\n11 Alkaline earth metal Appearance Ease of cutting Melting point (oC) Boiling point (oC) Conduct- ivity 1st ionization energy 2nd ionization energy Beryllium Shiny grey Not easy 1280 3450 Good 900 1800 Magnesium Shiny grey Not Easy 650 1110 Good 736 1450 calcium Shiny grey Not easy 850 1140 Good 590 970 Chemical properties (i)Reaction with air/oxygen On exposure to air, the surface of alkaline earth metals is slowly oxidized to its oxide on prolonged exposure to air."

They therefore are therefore monovalent .They exist in oxidation state X- The number of energy levels increases down the group from Fluorine to Astatine. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Chlorine is bigger/larger than that of Fluorine because Chlorine has more/3 energy levels than Fluorine (2 energy levels). 17 Atomic radius and ionic radius of Halogens increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The atomic radius of Halogens is smaller than the ionic radius. This is because they react by gaining/acquiring extra one electron in the outer energy level. The effective nuclear attraction on the more/extra electrons decreases. The incoming extra electron is also repelled causing the outer energy level to expand to reduce the repulsion and accommodate more electrons.

Electronegativity The ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons is called electronegativity. All halogens are electronegative. Electronegativity decreases as atomic radius increase. This is because the effective nuclear attraction on outer electrons decreases with increase in atomic radius. The outer electrons experience less nuclear attraction and thus ease of gaining/acquiring extra electrons decrease. It is measured using Pauling’s scale. Where Fluorine with Pauling scale 4.0 is the most electronegative element and thus the highest tendency to acquire/gain extra electron. Table showing the electronegativity of the halogens. Halogen F Cl Br I At Electronegativity (Pauling scale) 4.0 3.0 2.8 2.5 2.2\n18 The electronegativity of the halogens decrease down the group from fluorine to Astatine. This is because atomic radius increases down the group and thus decrease electron – attracting power down the group from fluorine to astatine. Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table because it has the small atomic radius. Electron affinity The minimum amount of energy required to gain/acquire an extra electron by an atom of element in its gaseous state is called 1st electron affinity. The SI unit of electron affinity is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 . Electron affinity depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons and thus the lower the electron affinity."
"The SI unit of electron affinity is kilojoules per mole/kJmole-1 . Electron affinity depend on atomic radius. The higher the atomic radius, the less effective the nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons and thus the lower the electron affinity. For halogens the 1st electron affinity decrease down the group as the atomic radius increase and the effective nuclear attraction on outer energy level electrons decrease. Due to its small size/atomic radius Fluorine shows exceptionally low electron affinity. This is because a lot of energy is required to overcome the high repulsion of the existing and incoming electrons. Table showing the election affinity of halogens for the process X + e -> X- The higher the electron affinity the more stable theion.i.e Cl- is a more stable ion than Br- because it has a more negative / exothermic electron affinity than Br- Electron affinity is different from: (i) Ionization energy. Ionization energy is the energy required to lose/donate an electron in an atom of an element in its gaseous state while electron affinity is the energy required to gain/acquire extra electron by an atom of an element in its gaseous state. (ii) Electronegativity. -Electron affinity is the energy required to gain an electron in an atom of an element in gaseous state.

Physical properties State at room temperature Fluorine and Chlorine are gases, Bromine is a liquid and Iodine is a solid. Astatine is radioactive . All halogens exist as diatomic molecules bonded by strong covalent bond. Each molecule is joined to the other by weak intermolecular forces/ Van-der-waals forces. Melting/Boiling point The strength of intermolecular/Van-der-waals forces of attraction increase with increase in molecular size/atomic radius. Iodine has therefore the largest atomic radius and thus strongest intermolecular forces to make it a solid. Iodine sublimes when heated to form (caution: highly toxic/poisonous) purple vapour."
"Melting/Boiling point The strength of intermolecular/Van-der-waals forces of attraction increase with increase in molecular size/atomic radius. Iodine has therefore the largest atomic radius and thus strongest intermolecular forces to make it a solid. Iodine sublimes when heated to form (caution: highly toxic/poisonous) purple vapour. This is because Iodine molecules are held together by weak van-derwaals/intermolecular forces which require little heat energy to break. Electrical conductivity All Halogens are poor conductors of electricity because they have no free delocalized electrons. Solubility in polar and non-polar solvents All halogens are soluble in water(polar solvent). When a boiling tube containing either chlorine gas or bromine vapour is separately inverted in a beaker containing distilled water and tetrachloromethane (non-polar solvent), the level of solution in boiling tube rises in both water and tetrachloromethane. This is because halogen are soluble in both polar and non-polar solvents. Solubility of halogens in water/polar solvents decrease down the group. Solubility of halogens in non-polar solvent increase down the group. The level of water in chlorine is higher than in bromine and the level of tetrachloromethane in chlorine is lower than in bromine.

(c)Group VIII elements: Noble gases Group VIII elements are called Noble gases. They are all non metals. Noble gases occupy about 1.0% of the atmosphere as colourless gaseous mixture. Argon is the most abundant with 0.9%. They exists as monatomic molecules with very weak van-der-waals /intermolecular forces holding the molecules. They include: All noble gas atoms have a stable duplet(two electrons in the 1st energy level) or octet(eight electrons in other outer energy level)in the outer energy level. They therefore do not acquire/gain extra electron in the outer energy level or donate/lose. They therefore are therefore zerovalent . The number of energy levels increases down the group from Helium to Randon."
"They therefore do not acquire/gain extra electron in the outer energy level or donate/lose. They therefore are therefore zerovalent . The number of energy levels increases down the group from Helium to Randon. The more the number of energy levels the bigger/larger the atomic size/radius. e.g. The atomic size/radius of Argon is bigger/larger than that of Neon because Argon has more/3 energy levels than Neon (2 energy levels). Atomic radius noble gases increase down the group as the number of energy levels increases. The effective nuclear attraction on the outer electrons thus decrease down the group. The noble gases are generally unreactive because the outer energy level has the stable octet/duplet. The stable octet/duplet in noble gas atoms lead to a comparatively very high 1st ionization energy. This is because losing /donating an electron from the stable atom require a lot of energy to lose/donate and make it unstable.

Noble gases have low melting and boiling points. This is because they exist as monatomic molecules joined by very weak intermolecular/van-der-waals forces that require very little energy to weaken and form liquid and break to form a gas. The intermolecular/van-der-waals forces increase down the group as the atomic radius/size increase from Helium to Radon. The melting and boiling points thus increase also down the group. Noble gases are insoluble in water and are poor conductors of electricity."

Neon is used in street and advertisement light Helium is mixed with Oxygen during deep sea diving and mountaineering. Helium is used in weather balloon for meteorological research instead of Hydrogen because it is unreactive/inert. Hydrogen when impure can ignite with an explosion. Helium is used in making thermometers for measuring very low temperatures. STRUCTURE AND BONDING IONIC (ELECTROVALENT) BONDING Noble gases like neon or argon have eight electrons in their outer shells (or two in the case of helium). These noble gas structures are thought of as being in some way a \"desirable\" thing for an atom to have. When other atoms react, they try to organise electrons such that their outer shells are either completely full or completely empty. Chemical reactions occur so that atoms attain inert gas configuration by either losing valency electrons as in the case of metals, or gaining electrons as in the case of non metals. Ionic bonding in sodium chloride Sodium (2,8,1) has 1 electron more than a stable noble gas structure (2,8). If it gave away that electron it would become more stable. Chlorine (2,8,7) has 1 electron short of a stable noble gas structure (2,8,8)."
"Ionic bonding in sodium chloride Sodium (2,8,1) has 1 electron more than a stable noble gas structure (2,8). If it gave away that electron it would become more stable. Chlorine (2,8,7) has 1 electron short of a stable noble gas structure (2,8,8). If it could gain an electron from somewhere it too would become more stable. If a sodium atom gives an electron to a chlorine atom, both become more stable. The sodium has lost an electron, so it no longer has equal numbers of electrons and protons. Because it has one more proton than electron, it has a charge of 1+. If electrons are lost from an atom, positive ions are formed. Positive ions are sometimes called cations because they move to the cathode during electrolysis. The chlorine has gained an electron, so it now has one more electron than proton. It therefore has a charge of 1-. If electrons are gained by an atom, negative ions are formed. A negative ion is sometimes called an anion since it drifts to the anode during electrolysis. The nature of ionic bond The sodium ions and chloride ions are held together by the strong electrostatic attractions between the positive and negative charges. You need one sodium atom to provide the extra electron for one chlorine atom, so they combine together 1:1. The formula is therefore NaCl. Properties of ionic compounds  All compounds with ionic bonding produce giant ionic structures.  Consist of oppositely charged ions arranged in an ionic lattice, the ions are held together by strong ionic bonds. e.g. NaCl is composed of Na+ ions and Cl- ions.  These bonds are hard to break, therefore ionic substances have very high melting and boiling points.  All exist as solids.  They conduct electricity when molten, because the ions are free to move, but do not conduct when solid.  They conduct electricity in the aqueous state because the ions are free to move.  Most ionic substances are soluble in water because the polar water molecules can accommodate the charged ions. COVALENT BONDING - SINGLE BONDS As well as achieving noble gas structures by transferring electrons from one atom to another as in ionic bonding, it is also possible for atoms to reach these stable structures by sharing electrons to give covalent bonds."
" They conduct electricity in the aqueous state because the ions are free to move.  Most ionic substances are soluble in water because the polar water molecules can accommodate the charged ions. COVALENT BONDING - SINGLE BONDS As well as achieving noble gas structures by transferring electrons from one atom to another as in ionic bonding, it is also possible for atoms to reach these stable structures by sharing electrons to give covalent bonds. Depending on the number of electron pairs shared between atoms which participate in bonding, covalent bonds are classified as follows: Some simple covalent molecules Chlorine For example, two chlorine atoms could both achieve stable structures by sharing their single unpaired electron as in the diagram. The fact that one chlorine has been drawn with electrons marked as crosses and the other as dots is simply to show where all the electrons come from. In reality there is no difference between them. The two chlorine atoms are said to be joined by a covalent bond. The reason that the two chlorine atoms stick together is that the shared pair of electrons is attracted to the nucleus of both chlorine atoms. Hydrogen Hydrogen atoms only need two electrons in their outer level to reach the noble gas structure of helium. Once again, the covalent bond holds the two atoms together because the pair of electrons is attracted to both nuclei. This is another single bond. Hydrogen chloride\nThe hydrogen has a helium structure, and the chlorine an argon structure. Water Oxygen atom has six electrons in the outer shell, while each of the two hydrogen atoms has one each. After bonding, oxygen has 8 electrons while each hydrogen atom has two as shown by the molecule. NITROGEN GAS Each nitrogen atom has five electrons in the outer shell. Each needs 3 electrons to complete the outer shell. In the formation of the molecule, each nitrogen atom contributes three electrons and a triple bond is formed Characteristics of Covalent Compounds 1) Covalent compounds consist of molecules and not ions. The molecules do not have any electric charge on them. The molecules are held together by weak forces called Van der Waal's forces. 2) Covalent compounds are gases, volatile liquids or soft solids. As there are weak, Van der Waal's forces between the molecules, they are not held in rigid position. The state depends on the bond energy. If the bond energy is very low, they stay as gases, if it is appreciable they are volatile liquids."
"As there are weak, Van der Waal's forces between the molecules, they are not held in rigid position. The state depends on the bond energy. If the bond energy is very low, they stay as gases, if it is appreciable they are volatile liquids. If very high, they exist as soft solids. 3) Covalent compounds generally have low melting and boiling points. As Van der Waal's forces are weak, a very small amount of energy is required to break the bond between the molecules corresponding to low melting point and boiling point. 4) Covalent compounds dissolve in organic solvents. As they do not contain ions, solvation does not take place when water is added to the compound. Hence they do not dissolve in water. 5) Covalent compounds are bad conductors of electricity. They do not contain ions in the fused state, nor do ions migrate on application of an electric potential. Hence, there is no conduction of current. 6) Covalent compounds are less dense when compared to water. Very weak Van der Waal's forces hold the molecules together, hence there are large inter molecular spaces. Consequently less number of molecules per unit volume, which means mass per unit volume is also less. Hence they have a low density. Exceptions  Diamond and graphite, the allotropes of carbon have high melting point.  Hydrogen chloride in the aqueous state conducts electricity. The giant covalent structure of diamond Carbon has an electronic arrangement of 2, 4. In diamond, each carbon shares electrons with four other carbon atoms - forming four single bonds. In the diagram some carbon atoms only seem to be forming two bonds (or even one bond), but that's not really the case. We are only showing a small bit of the whole structure. This is a giant covalent structure - it continues on and on in three dimensions. It is not a molecule, because the number of atoms joined up in a real diamond is completely variable - depending on the size of the crystal. The physical properties of diamond Diamond  Has a very high melting point (almost 4000°C). Very strong carbon-carbon covalent bonds have to be broken throughout the structure before melting occurs.  Is very hard. This is again due to the need to break very strong covalent bonds operating in 3dimensions.  Doesnಬt conduct electricity. All the electrons are held tightly between the atoms, and aren't free to move."
"This is again due to the need to break very strong covalent bonds operating in 3dimensions.  Doesnಬt conduct electricity. All the electrons are held tightly between the atoms, and aren't free to move.  Is insoluble in water and organic solvents. There are no possible attractions which could occur between solvent molecules and carbon atoms which could outweigh the attractions between the covalently bound carbon atoms. The giant covalent structure of graphite Graphite has a layer structure which is quite difficult to draw convincingly in three dimensions. The diagram below shows the arrangement of the atoms in each layer, and the way the layers are spaced. The bonding in graphite Each carbon atom uses three of its electrons to form simple bonds to its three close neighbours. That leaves a fourth electron in the bonding level. These \"spare\" electrons in each carbon atom become delocalised over the whole of the sheet of atoms in one layer. They are no longer associated directly with any particular atom or pair of atoms, but are free to wander throughout the whole sheet. The important thing is that the delocalised electrons are free to move anywhere within the sheet - each electron is no longer fixed to a particular carbon atom. There is, however, no direct contact between the delocalised electrons in one sheet and those in the neighbouring sheets. The atoms within a sheet are held together by strong covalent bonds - stronger, in fact, than in diamond because of the additional bonding caused by the delocalised electrons. So what holds the sheets together? In graphite you have the ultimate example of van der Waals dispersion forces. As the delocalised electrons move around in the sheet, very large temporary dipoles can be set up which will induce opposite dipoles in the sheets above and below - and so on throughout the whole graphite crystal. The physical properties of graphite Graphite  Has a high melting point, similar to that of diamond. In order to melt graphite, it isn't enough to loosen one sheet from another. You have to break the covalent bonding throughout the whole structure.  Has a soft, slippery feel, and is used in pencils and as a dry lubricant for things like locks. You can think of graphite rather like a pack of cards - each card is strong, but the cards will slide over each other, or even fall off the pack altogether. When you use a pencil, sheets are rubbed off and stick to the paper.  Has a lower density than diamond."
"You can think of graphite rather like a pack of cards - each card is strong, but the cards will slide over each other, or even fall off the pack altogether. When you use a pencil, sheets are rubbed off and stick to the paper.  Has a lower density than diamond. This is because of the relatively large amount of space that is \"wasted\" between the sheets.  Is insoluble in water and organic solvents - for the same reason that diamond is insoluble. Attractions between solvent molecules and carbon atoms will never be strong enough to overcome the strong covalent bonds in graphite.  Conducts electricity. The delocalised electrons are free to move throughout the sheets. If a piece of graphite is connected into a circuit, electrons can fall off one end of the sheet and be replaced with new ones at the other end. The structure of silicon dioxide, SiO2 Silicon dioxide is also known as silicon (IV) oxide. The giant covalent structure of silicon dioxide There are three different crystal forms of silicon dioxide. The easiest one to remember and draw is based on the diamond structure. Crystalline silicon has the same structure as diamond. To turn it into silicon dioxide, all you need to do is to modify the silicon structure by including some oxygen atoms. Notice that each silicon atom is bridged to its neighbours by an oxygen atom. Don't forget that this is just a tiny part of a giant structure extending on all 3 dimensions. The physical properties of silicon dioxide Silicon dioxide  Has a high melting point - varying depending on what the particular structure is (remember that the structure given is only one of three possible structures), but around 1700°C. Very strong silicon-oxygen covalent bonds have to be broken throughout the structure before melting occurs.  Is hard. This is due to the need to break the very strong covalent bonds.  Doesnಬt conduct electricity. There aren't any delocalised electrons. All the electrons are held tightly between the atoms, and aren't free to move.  Is insoluble in water and organic solvents. There are no possible attractions which could occur between solvent molecules and the silicon or oxygen atoms which could overcome the covalent bonds in the giant structure.

CO-ORDINATE (DATIVE COVALENT) BONDING Co-ordinate (dative covalent) bonding A covalent bond is formed by two atoms sharing a pair of electrons. The atoms are held together because the electron pair is attracted by both of the nuclei. In the formation of a simple covalent bond, each atom supplies one electron to the bond - but that doesn't have to be the case. A co-ordinate bond (also called a\ndative covalent bond) is a covalent bond (a shared pair of electrons) in which both electrons come from the same atom. The reaction between ammonia and hydrogen chloride If these colourless gases are allowed to mix, a thick white smoke of solid ammonium chloride is formed. Ammonium ions, NH4+, are formed by the transfer of a hydrogen ion from the hydrogen chloride to the lone pair of electrons on the ammonia molecule. When the ammonium ion, NH4+, is formed, the fourth hydrogen is attached by a dative covalent bond, because only the hydrogen's nucleus is transferred from the chlorine to the nitrogen. The hydrogen's electron is left behind on the chlorine to form a negative chloride ion. Once the ammonium ion has been formed it is impossible to tell any difference between the dative covalent and the ordinary covalent bonds. Although the electrons are shown differently in the diagram, there is no difference between them in reality. INTERMOLECULAR BONDING - VAN DER WAALS FORCES (a) VAN DER WAALS FORCES Intermolecular attractions are attractions between one molecule and a neighbouring molecule. The forces of attraction which hold an individual molecule together (for example, the covalent bonds) are known as\nintramolecular attractions. All molecules experience intermolecular attractions, although in some cases those attractions are very weak. Even in a gas like hydrogen, H2, if you slow the molecules down by cooling the gas, the attractions are large enough for the molecules to stick together eventually to form a liquid and then a solid."
"The forces of attraction which hold an individual molecule together (for example, the covalent bonds) are known as\nintramolecular attractions. All molecules experience intermolecular attractions, although in some cases those attractions are very weak. Even in a gas like hydrogen, H2, if you slow the molecules down by cooling the gas, the attractions are large enough for the molecules to stick together eventually to form a liquid and then a solid. In hydrogen's case the attractions are so weak that the molecules have to be cooled to (-252°C) before the attractions are enough to condense the hydrogen as a liquid. Helium's intermolecular attractions are even weaker - the molecules won't stick together to form a liquid until the temperature drops to (-269°C). HYDROGEN BONDING Polar molecules, such as water molecules, have a weak, partial negative charge at one region of the molecule (the oxygen atom in water) and a partial positive charge elsewhere (the hydrogen atoms in water). Thus when water molecules are close together, their positive and negative regions are attracted to the oppositely-charged regions of nearby molecules. The force of attraction, shown here as a dotted line, is called a hydrogen bond. Each water molecule is hydrogen bonded to four others. The hydrogen bonds that form between water molecules account for some of the essential — and unique — properties of water.  The attraction created by hydrogen bonds keeps water liquid over a wider range of temperature than is found for any other molecule its size.  The energy required to break multiple hydrogen bonds causes water to have a high heat of vaporization; that is; a large amount of energy is needed to convert liquid water, where the molecules are attracted through their hydrogen bonds, to water vapor, where they are not. Liquid Water and Hydrogen Bonding Why water is a liquid? In many ways, water is a miracle liquid. Since the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the molecule carry opposite (though partial) charges, nearby water molecules are attracted to each other like tiny little magnets. Hydrogen bonding makes water molecules \"stick\" together. This makes water have high melting and boiling points compared to other covalent compounds such as ammonia (NH3) which have similar molecular mass but are gases Ice and Hydrogen Bonding The structure that forms in the solid ice crystal actually has large holes in it. Therefore, in a given volume of ice, there are fewer water molecules than in the same volume of liquid water."
"Hydrogen bonding makes water molecules \"stick\" together.

Therefore, in a given volume of ice, there are fewer water molecules than in the same volume of liquid water. In other words, ice is less dense than liquid water and will float on the surface of the liquid. Surface Tension and hydrogen bonding As we just discussed, neighboring water molecules are attracted to one another. Molecules at the surface of liquid water have fewer neighbors and, as a result, have a greater attraction to the few water molecules that are nearby. This enhanced attraction is called surface tension. It makes the surface of the liquid slightly more difficult to break through than the interior. Water as a Solvent The partial charge that develops across the water molecule helps make it an excellent solvent. Water dissolves many substances by surrounding charged particles and \"pulling\" them into solution. For example, common table salt, sodium chloride, is an ionic substance that contains alternating sodium and chlorine ions. When table salt is added to water, the partial charges on the water molecule are attracted to the Na+ and Cl- ions. Why does ethanol have a higher boiling point than methoxymethane? Ethanol, CH3CH2-O-H, and methoxymethane, CH3-O-CH3, both have the same molecular formula, C2H6O. They have the same number of electrons, and a similar length to the molecule. The van der Waals attractions (both dispersion forces and dipole-dipole attractions) in each will be much the same. However, ethanol has a hydrogen atom attached directly to oxygen - and that oxygen still has exactly the same two lone pairs as in a water molecule. Hydrogen bonding can occur between ethanol molecules, although not as effectively as in water. The hydrogen bonding is limited by the fact that there is only one hydrogen in each ethanol molecule with sufficient + charge. In methoxymethane, the lone pairs on the oxygen are still there, but the hydrogens aren't sufficiently + for hydrogen bonds to form. Except in some rather unusual cases, the hydrogen atom has to be attached directly to the very electronegative element for hydrogen bonding to occur."

Except in some rather unusual cases, the hydrogen atom has to be attached directly to the very electronegative element for hydrogen bonding to occur. The boiling points of ethanol and methoxymethane show the dramatic effect that the hydrogen bonding has on the stickiness of the ethanol molecules:\nethanol (with hydrogen bonding) 78.5°C methoxymethane (without hydrogen bonding) -24.8°C The hydrogen bonding in the ethanol has lifted its boiling point about 100°C.It is important to realise that hydrogen bonding exists in addition to van der Waals attractions. For example, all the following molecules contain the same number of electrons, and the first two are much the same length. The higher boiling point of the butan-1-ol is due to the additional hydrogen bonding. 4. BONDING IN METALS Bonding in metals Metal atoms have relatively few electrons in their outer shells. When they are packed together, each metal atom loses its outer electrons into a ಫseaಬ of free electrons (or mobile electrons). Having lost electrons, the atoms are no longer electrically neutral. They become positive ions because they have lost electrons but the number of protons in the nucleus has remained unchanged. Therefore the structure of a metal is made up of positive ions packed together. These ions are surrounded by electrons, which can move freely between the ions.  An ion is a charged particle made from an atom by the loss or gain of electrons.  Metal atoms most easily lose electrons, so they become positive ions. In doing so they achieve a more stable electron arrangement, usually that of the nearest noble gas. These free electrons are delocalized (not restricted to orbiting one positive ion) and form a kind of electrostatic ಫglueಬ holding the structure together. In an electrical circuit, metals can conduct electricity because the mobile electrons can move through the structure carrying charge. His type of bonding (called metallic boding) is present in alloys as well. Alloys, for example solder and brass, will conduct electricity. The physical properties of metals: This strong bonding generally results in dense, strong materials with high melting and boiling points."
"His type of bonding (called metallic boding) is present in alloys as well. Alloys, for example solder and brass, will conduct electricity. The physical properties of metals: This strong bonding generally results in dense, strong materials with high melting and boiling points. Usually a relatively large amount of energy is needed to melt or boil metals. a. Metals are good conductors of electricity because these 'free' electrons carry the charge of an electric current when a potential difference (voltage!) is applied across a piece of metal. b. Metals are also good conductors of heat. This is also due to the free moving electrons. Nonmetallic solids conduct heat energy by hotter more strongly vibrating atoms, knocking against cooler less strongly vibrating atoms to pass the particle kinetic energy on. In metals, as well as this effect, the 'hot' high kinetic energy electrons move around freely to transfer the particle kinetic energy more efficiently to 'cooler' atoms. c. Typical metals also have a silvery surface but remember this may be easily tarnished by corrosive oxidation in air and water. d. Unlike ionic solids, metals are very malleable, they can be readily bent, pressed or hammered into shape. INTRODUCTION TO SALTS 1.(a) A salt is an ionic compound formed when the cation from a base combine with the anion derived from an acid.

A compound that is decomposed by an electric current is called an electrolyte. Some electrolytes are weak while others are strong. 2.Strong electrolytes are those that are fully ionized/dissociated into (many) ions. Common strong electrolytes include: (i)all mineral acids (ii)all strong alkalis/sodium hydroxide/potassium hydroxide. (iii)all soluble salts 3.Weak electrolytes are those that are partially/partly ionized/dissociated into (few) ions. Common weak electrolytes include: (i)all organic acids (ii)all bases except sodium hydroxide/potassium hydroxide. (iii)Water 4. A compound that is not decomposed by an electric current is called nonelectrolyte."

An electrolytes in solid state have fused /joined ions and therefore do not conduct electricity but the ions (cations and anions) are free and mobile in molten and aqueous (solution, dissolved in water) state. 6.During electrolysis, the free ions are attracted to the electrodes. An electrode is a rod through which current enter and leave the electrolyte during electrolysis. 2 An electrode that does not influence/alter the products of electrolysis is called an inert electrode. Common inert electrodes include: (i)Platinum (ii)Carbon graphite Platinum is not usually used in a school laboratory because it is very expensive. Carbon graphite is easily/readily and cheaply available (from used dry cells). 7.The positive electrode is called Anode.The anode is the electrode through which current enter the electrolyte/electrons leave the electrolyte 8.The negative electrode is called Cathode. The cathode is the electrode through which current leave the electrolyte / electrons enter the electrolyte 9. During the electrolysis, free anions are attracted to the anode where they lose /donate electrons to form neutral atoms/molecules. i.e. M(l) -> M+(l) + e (for cations from molten electrolytes) M(s) -> M+(aq) + e (for cations from electrolytes in aqueous state / solution / dissolved in water) The neutral atoms /molecules form the products of electrolysis at the anode. This is called discharge at anode 10. During electrolysis, free cations are attracted to the cathode where they gain /accept/acquire electrons to form neutral atoms/molecules."
