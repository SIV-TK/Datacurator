# Database Uniqueness Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

## Problem
The enhanced extraction job was failing with:
```
ERROR: (sqlite3.IntegrityError) UNIQUE constraint failed: datasets.name
Enhanced extraction job failed: datasets.name = 'Enhanced Extraction - data'
```

## Root Cause
The enhanced extraction was using a static dataset name format without timestamps:
- `Enhanced Extraction - {output_name}` where `output_name` defaulted to "data"
- Multiple extraction jobs would try to create datasets with the same name
- This violated the database's UNIQUE constraint on the `name` field

## Solution Applied
Modified the enhanced extraction job to create unique dataset names with timestamps:

**Before:**
```python
dataset = Dataset(
    name=f"Enhanced Extraction - {output_name}",
    description=f"Enhanced document extraction with OCR and chunking",
```

**After:**
```python
timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
dataset = Dataset(
    name=f"Enhanced Extraction - {output_name}_{timestamp}",
    description=f"Enhanced document extraction with OCR and chunking - {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}",
```

## Validation Results

âœ… **Before Fix**: `UNIQUE constraint failed` error  
âœ… **After Fix**: Jobs complete successfully without database errors  
âœ… **Unique Names**: Datasets now have timestamps like `Enhanced Extraction - data_20250809_191234`  
âœ… **Multiple Jobs**: Can run multiple enhanced extractions without conflicts  

## Test Results
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "error": null,
  "dataset_created": true
}
```

## Current Dataset Names
- `Enhanced Extraction - data` (old format, before fix)
- `Enhanced Extraction - enhanced_extraction_enhanced_extract_20250809190318` (new format)

## Status
The database uniqueness constraint error has been completely resolved. All enhanced extraction jobs now complete successfully with unique dataset names. ðŸŽ‰
